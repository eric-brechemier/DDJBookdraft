= The Data Journalism Handbook =

== For the great unnamed ==

The Data Journalism Handbook was born at a 48 hour workshop at MozFest 2011 in London. It subsequently spilled over into an international, collaborative effort involving dozens of data journalism's leading advocates and best practitioners.

In the 6 months that passed between the book's inception to its first full release, hundreds of people have been contributed in various ways. While we have done our best to keep track of them all, we have had our fair share of anonymous, pseudonymous and untraceable edits.

To all of those people who have contributed and are not listed below, we say two things. Firstly, thank you. Secondly, can please tell us who you are so that we can give credit where credit is due.
