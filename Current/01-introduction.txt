=== What Is Data Journalism? (Paul Bradshaw, City University) ===

image::Figures/01-01.png[width=600]

What is data journalism? I could answer, simply, that it is journalism done with data. But that doesn't help much.

Both `data' and `journalism' are troublesome terms. Some people think of `data' as any collection of numbers, most likely gathered on a spreadsheet. 20 years ago, that was pretty much the only sort of data that journalists dealt with. But we live in a digital world now, a world in which almost anything can be - and almost everything is - described with numbers.

Your career history, 300,000 confidential documents, who knows who in your circle of friends can all be - and are - described with just two numbers: zeroes, and ones. Photos, video and audio are all described with the same two numbers: zeroes and ones. Murders, disease, political votes, corruption and lies: zeroes and ones.

What makes data journalism different to the rest of journalism? Perhaps it is the new possibilities that open up when you combine the traditional `nose for news' and ability to tell a compelling story, with the sheer scale and range of digital information now available.

And those possibilities can come at any stage of the journalist's process: using programming to automate the process of gathering and combining information from across the web, as Adrian Holovaty did with http://chicago.everyblock.com/crime/[ChicagoCrime] and then http://www.everyblock.com/[EveryBlock].

Or using software to find connections between hundreds of thousands of documents, as The Telegraph did with http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/[MPs' expenses].

Data journalism can help a journalist tell a complex story through engaging infographics - such as Hans Rosling's talks on world poverty with http://www.gapminder.org/[Gapminder] or David McCandless's visualisation work with http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/[Information is Beautiful]. Or it can help explain how a story relates to an individual, as the BBC and FT now routinely do with their budget interactives. And it can open up the newsgathering process itself, as The Guardian do so successfully with their http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog[Datablog].

Data can be the source of data journalism, or it can be the tool with which the story is told - or it can be both. Like any source, it should be treated with scepticism; and like any tool, we should be conscious of how it can shape and restrict the stories that are created with it.

=== Why Journalists Should Use Data (Mirko Lorenz, Deutsche Welle) ===

Journalism is under siege. In the past we relied on being the only ones operating a technology to multiply and distribute what had happened over night. The printing press served as a gateway, if anybody wanted reach the people of a city or region the next morning, they would turn to newspapers. This is over.

Today news stories are flowing in as they happen, from multiple sources, eye-witnesses, blogs and what has happened is filtered through a vast network of social connections, being ranked, commented and more often than not: ignored.

This is why data journalism is so important. Gathering, filtering and visualising what is happening beyond what the eye can see has a growing value. The orange juice you drink in the morning, the coffee you brew - in today's global economy there are invisible connections between things, networks and people. The language of this network is data: little points of information that are often not relevant in a single instance, but massively important when viewed from the right angle.

Right now, a few pioneering journalists already demonstrate how data can be used to create deeper insights into what is happening around us and how it might affect us.

Data analysis can reveal "a story's shape" (Sarah Cohen). It provides a "new camera" (David McCandless). To get to that point the data investigation must be done in a step by step process that is in some ways similar to uncovering a lost city from the dirt by slowly brushing away all the stuff that keeps us from seeing its structure.

But why should journalists be interested in learning how to work with data when doing research for stories? There are several reasons: First, journalists are help to identify and disseminate what is important and relevant. At least if they are good. How this is done might sometimes be incisive and inspiring, at other times sloppy, over-hasty or misleading. But, quite simply, in doing this job journalists strive to help us understand the world around us.

Using data the job of journalists shifts its main focus from being the first ones to report to being the ones telling us what a certain development might actually mean. The range of topics can be far and wide. The next financial crisis that is in the making. The economics behind the products we use. The misuse of funds or political blundery.

There is one barrier keeping journalists from using this potential: training in order to learn how to work with data through all the steps from a first question to a big data-driven scoop.

Working with data is like stepping into vast, unknown territory. At first look, raw data is puzzling the eyes and the mind. Data as such is unwieldy, it is quite hard to shape it correctly for visualisation. It needs experienced journalists, who have the stamina to look at often confusing, often boring raw data and "see" the hidden stories in there. 

On the other side: What choice do we as journalists have? Working with data can provide us with deep, original ways to report about what is going on. Once the data is ``speaking'' to us, all of sudden a very rich source to tell stories has opened up.

And, increasingly, journalists see that particular opportunity. The European Journalism Centre http://datadrivenjournalism.net/news_and_analysis/training_data_driven_journalism_mind_the_gaps[conducted a survey] to find out more about training needs of journalists. We found there is a big willingness to get out of the comfort zone of traditional journalism and invest time to master the new skills. The results from the survey showed us that journalists are "seeing" the opportunity, but need a bit of support to cut through the initial problems keeping them from working with data. There is a confidence, that should data journalism get more adopted, the work flows, the tools and the results will improve quite quickly. Pioneers such as the Guardian, the New York Times, the Texas Tribune and Die Zeit continue to raise the bar with their data-driven stories. 

Will data journalism remain the preserve of a small handful of pioneers - or will every news organisation soon have its own dedicated data journalism team? We hope this handbook will help more journalists and newsrooms to take advantage of this emerging field.

=== Why Is Data Journalism Important? (Various Contributors) ===

We asked some of data journalism's leading practitioners and proponents why they think data journalism is an important development. Here is what they said.

*Filtering the Flow of Data*

[quote, Philip Meyer (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill)]
____
When information was scarce, most of our efforts were devoted to hunting and gathering. Now that information is abundant, processing is more important. We process at two levels: (1) analysis to bring sense and structure out of the never-ending flow of data and (2) presentation to get what's important and relevant into the consumer's head. Like science, data journalism discloses its methods and presents its findings in a way that can be verified by replication.
____

*New Approaches to Storytelling*

[quote, Aron Pilhofer (New York Times)]
____
Data journalism is an umbrella term that, to my mind, encompasses an ever-growing set of tools, techniques and approaches to storytelling. It can include everything from traditional computer-assisted reporting (using data as a `source') to the most cutting edge data visualisation and news applications. The unifying goal is a journalistic one: providing information and analysis to help inform us all about important issues of the day.
____

*Like Photo Journalism with a Laptop*

[quote, Brian Boyer (Chicago Tribune)]
____
`Data journalism' only differs from `words journalism' in that we use a different kit. We all sniff out, report, and relate stories for a living. It's like `photo journalism' - just swap the camera for a laptop.
____

*Number-Crunching Meets Word-Smithing*

[quote, David Anderton (Freelance Journalist)]
____
Data journalism is bridging the gap between stat technicians and wordsmiths. Locating outliers and identifying trends that are not just statistically significant, but relevant to de-compiling the inherently complex world of today.
____


*Updating Your Skills Set*

[quote, Jerry Vermanen (NU.nl)]
____
Data journalism is a new set of skills for searching, understanding and visualising digital sources in a time that basic skills from traditional journalism just aren't enough. It's not a replacement of traditional journalism, but an addition to it.

In a time where sources go digital, journalists can and have to be closer to those sources. The Internet opened up possibilities beyond our current understanding. Data journalism is just the beginning of evolving our past practices to adapt to the online.

Data journalism serves two important purposes for news organisations: finding unique stories (not from news wires) and execute your watchdog function. Especially in times of financial peril, these are important goals for newspapers to achieve.

From the standpoint of a regional newspaper, data journalism is crucial. We have the saying `a loose tile in front of your door is considered more important than a riot in a far-away country'. It's hits you in the face and impacts your life more directly. At the same time, digitisation is everywhere. Because local newspapers have this direct impact in their neighbourhood and sources become digitalised, a journalist must know how to find, analyse and visualise a story from data.
____


*A Remedy for Information Asymmetry*

[quote, Tom Fries (Bertelsmann Foundation)]
____
Information asymmetry - not the lack of information, but the inability to take in and process it with the speed and volume that it comes to us - is one of the most significant problems that citizens face in making choices about how to live their lives. Information taken in from print, visual and audio media influence citizens' choices and actions. Good data journalism helps to combat information asymmetry.
____

*An Answer to Data-driven PR*

[quote, Nicolas Kayser-Bril (Independent Data Journalist)]
____
The availability of measurement tools and their decreasing prices, in a self-sustaining combination with a focus on performance and efficiency in all aspects of society, have led decision-makers to quantify the progresses of their policies, monitor trends and identify opportunities.

Companies keep coming up with new metrics showing how well they perform. Politicians love to brag about reductions in unemployment numbers and increases in GDP. The lack of journalistic insight in the Enron, Worldcom, Madoff or Solyndra affairs is proof of many a journalist's inability to clearly see through numbers. Figures are more likely to be taken at face value than other facts as they carry an aura of seriousness, even when they are entirely fabricated.

Fluency with data will help journalists sharpen their critical sense when faced with numbers and will hopefully help them gain back some terrain in their exchanges with PR departments.
____

*To Provide Independent Interpretations of Official Information*

[quote, Isao Matsunami (Chunichi/Tokyo Shimbun)]
____
After the devastating earthquake and subsequent Fukushima nuclear plants disaster in 2011, the importance of data journalism has been driven home to media people in Japan, a country which is generally lagging behind in digital journalism.

We were at a loss when the government and experts had no credible data about the damage. When officials hid SPEEDI data (predicted diffusion of radioactive materials) from the public, we were not prepared to decode it even if it were leaked. Volunteers began to collect radioactive data by using their own devices but we were not armed with the knowledge of statistics, interpolation, visualisation and so on. Journalists need to have access to raw data, and to learn not to rely on official interpretations of it.

*Dealing with the Data Deluge*

[quote, Alex Howard (O'Reilly)]
____
The challenges and opportunities presented by the digital revolution continue to disrupt journalism. In an age of information abundance, journalists and citizens alike all need better tools, whether we're curating the samizdat of the 21st century in the Middle East, processing a late night data dump, or looking for the best way to visualise water quality for a nation of consumers. As we grapple with the consumption challenges presented by this deluge of data, new publishing platforms are also empowering everyone to gather and share data digitally, turning it into information.  While reporters and editors have been the traditional vectors for information gathering and dissemination, the flattened information environment of 2012 now has news breaking first online, not on the news-desk.

Around the globe, in fact, the bond between data and journalism is growing stronger. In an age of big data, the growing importance of data journalism lies in the ability of its practitioners to provide context, clarity and, perhaps most important, find truth in the expanding amount of digital content in the world. That doesn't mean that the integrated media organisations of today don't play a crucial role. Far from it. In the information age, journalists are needed more than ever to curate, verify, analyse and synthesise the wash of data.  In that context, data journalism has profound importance for society.

Today, making sense of big data, particularly unstructured data, will be a central goal for data scientists around the world, whether they work in newsrooms, Wall Street or Silicon Valley. Notably, that goal will be substantially enabled by a growing set of common tools, whether they're employed by government technologists opening Chicago, healthcare technologists or newsroom developers.

*Our Lives are Data*

[quote, Chris Taggart (Open Corporates)]
____
Good data journalism is hard, because good journalism is hard. It means figuring out how to get the data, how to understand it, and how to find the story. Sometimes there are dead ends, and sometimes there's no great story. After all if it were just a matter of pressing the right button, it wouldn't be journalism. But that's what makes it worthwhile, and - in a world where our lives are increasingly data - essential for a free and fair society.
____

*A Way to Save Time*

[quote, Pedro Markun (Transparência Hacker)]
____
Journalists don't have time to waste transcribing things by hand and messing around trying to get data out of PDFs so learning a little bit of code, or knowing where to look for people who can help, is incredibly valuable.

One reporter from Folha de São Paulo was working with the local budget and called me to thank us for putting up the accounts of the municipality of Sao Paolo online (two days work from a single hacker!). He said he had been transcribing them by hand for the past three months, trying to build up a story. I also remember solving a `PDF issue' for `Contas Abertas', a parliamentary monitoring news organisation: 15 minutes and 15 lines of code solved a months worth of work.
____

*An Essential Part of the Journalists' Toolkit*

[quote, Cynthia O'Murchu (Financial Times)]
____
I think it's important to stress the ``journalism'' or reporting aspect of `data journalism'. The exercise should not be about just analysing data or visualising data for the sake of it, but to use it as a tool to get closer to the truth of what is going on in the world. I see the ability to be able to analyse and interpret data as an essential part of today's journalists' toolkit, rather than a separate discipline. Ultimately, it is all about good reporting, and telling stories in the most appropriate way.

Data journalism is another way to scrutinise the world and hold the powers that be to account. With an increasing amount of data available, now more than ever it is important that journalists are of aware of it and how to work with it. This should be a tool in the toolkit of any journalist: whether learning how to work with data directly, or collaborating with someone who can.

Its real power is in helping you to obtain information that would otherwise be very difficult to find or to prove. A good example of this is Steve Doig's Hurricane Andrew story, where he joined two different datasets: one mapping the level of destruction caused by the hurricane and one showing wind speeds. This allowed him to pinpoint areas where there had been widespread building code violations. This was back in 1992 and its a great inspiration of what is possible.

Ideally you use the data to pinpoint outliers, areas of interest, or things which are surprising. In this sense data can act as a lead or a tip off. While this is interesting, data in itself is not enough. You still need to do the reporting to explain what it means.

*A Way to See Things You Might Not Otherwise See*

[quote, Cheryl Phillips (Seattle Times)]
____
Some stories can only be understood and explained through analysing - and sometimes visualising - the data. Connections between powerful people or entities would go unrevealed, deaths caused by drug policies that would remain hidden, environmental policies that hurt our landscape would continue unabated. But each of the above was changed because of data that journalists have obtained, analysed and provided to readers. The data can be as simple as a basic spreadsheet or a log of cell phone calls, or complex as school test scores or hospital infection data, but inside it all are stories worth telling.

=== Favourite Examples (Various Contributors) ===

We asked some of our contributors for their favourite examples of data journalism and what they liked about them. Here they are.

*Do No Harm by The Las Vegas Sun*

image::Figures/01-GG.png[width=600]

[quote, Angélica Peralta Ramos (La Nacion)]
____
My favourite example is the Las Vegas Sun's 2010 http://www.lasvegassun.com/hospital-care/[Do No Harm] series on hospital care. The Sun analysed more than 2.9 million hospital billing records, which revealed more than 3600 preventable injuries, infections and surgical mistakes. They obtained data through a public records request and identified more than 300 cases in which patients died because of mistakes that could have been prevented. It contains different elements, including: http://www.lasvegassun.com/hospital-care/surgical-injuries-interactive/[an interactive graphic] which allows the reader to see by hospital, where surgical injuries happened more often than would be expected; http://www.lasvegassun.com/hospital-care/infections-interactive/[a map] with a timeline that shows infections spreading hospital by hospital; and http://www.lasvegassun.com/hospital-care/events-chart/[an interactive graphic] that allows users to sort data by preventable injuries or by hospital to see where people are getting hurt. I like it because it is very easy to understand and navigate. Users can explore the data in a very intuitive way. Also it had a real impact: the Nevada legislature responded with http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2011/apr/14/health-care-transparency-bills-pass-key-milestone-[six pieces of legislation]. The journalists involved worked very hard to acquire and clean up the data. One of the journalists, Alex Richards, sent data back to hospitals and to the state http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/als-morning-meeting/128672/las-vegas-sun-pulitzer-finalists-explain-how-they-turned-data-into-web-gold/[at least a dozen times] to get mistakes corrected.

*Government Employee Salary Database*

image::Figures/01-FF.png[width=600]

[quote, Simon Rogers (Guardian Datablog)]
____
I love the work that small independent organisations are performing every day, such as Propublica or the Texas Tribune who have a great data reporter in Ryan Murphy. If I had to choose, I'd pick the http://www.texastribune.org/library/data/government-employee-salaries/[Government Employee Salary Database] project from the Texas Tribune. This project collects 660,000 government employee salaries into a database for users to search and help generate stories from. You can search by agency, name or salary. It's simple, meaningful and is making inaccessible information public. It is easy to use and automatically generates stories. It is a great example of why the Texas Tribune gets most of its traffic from the data pages.
____

*Full-text Visualisation of the Iraqi War Logs, Associated Press*

image::Figures/01-YY.jpg[width=600]

[quote, Cynthia O'Murchu (Financial Times)]
____
Jonathan Stray and Julian Burgess’ work on http://jonathanstray.com/a-full-text-visualization-of-the-iraq-war-logs[Iraq War Logs] is an inspiring foray into text analysis and visualisation using experimental techniques to gain insight into themes worth exploring further within a large textual dataset. 

By means of text-analytics techniques and algorithms, Jonathan and Julian created a method that showed clusters of keywords contained in thousands of US-government reports on the Iraq war leaked by Wikileaks in visual form.

Though there are limitations to the methods presented and the approach is experimental, it presents an innovative approach. Rather than trying to read all the files or reviewing the War Logs with a preconceived notion of what may be found by inputting particular keywords and reviewing the output, this technique calculates and visualises topics/keywords of particular relevance.

With increasing amounts of data - both textual (emails, reports, etc.) and numeric - coming into the public domain, finding ways to pinpoint key areas of interest will become more and more important - it is an exciting sub-field of data journalism.
____

*Murder Mysteries*

image::Figures/01-XX.jpg[width=600]

[quote, Steve Doig (Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication)]
____
One of my favorite pieces of data journalism is the http://projects.scrippsnews.com/magazine/murder-mysteries/[``Murder Mysteries''] project by Tom Hargrove of the Scripps Howard News Service. He built from government data and public records requests a demographically-detailed database of more than 185,000 unsolved murders, and then designed an algorithm to search it for patterns suggesting the possible presence of serial killers.  This project has it all: hard work gathering a database better than the government’s own, clever analysis using social science techniques, and interactive presentation of the data online so readers can explore it themselves.
____

*Message Machine*

image::Figures/01-HH.png[width=600]

[quote, Brian Boyer (Chicago Tribune)]
____
I love ProPublica's http://www.propublica.org/special/message-machine-you-probably-dont-know-janet[Message Machine] story and http://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/when-are-190-emails-like-six-emails[nerd blog post]. It all got started when some Twitterers expressed their curiosity about having received different emails from the Obama campaign. The folks at ProPublica noticed, and asked their audience to forward any emails they got from the campaign. The presentation is elegant, a visual diff of several different emails that were sent out that evening. It's awesome because they gathered their own data (admittedly a small sample, but big enough to tell the story). But it's even more awesome because they're telling the story of an emerging phenomena, big data used in political campaigns to target messages to specific individuals. It is just a taste of things to come.
