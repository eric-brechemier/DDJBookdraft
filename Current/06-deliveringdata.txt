=== How to build a news app by Chase Davis (Center for Investigative Reporting) ===

News applications are windows into the data behind a story. They might be searchable databases, sleek visualizations or something else altogether. But no matter what form they take, news apps encourage readers to interact with data in a context that is meaningful to them: looking up crime trends in their area, checking the safety records of their local doctor, or searching political contributions to their candidate of choice. 

More than just high-tech infographics, the best news apps are durable products. They live outside the news cycle, often by helping readers solve real-world problems, or answering questions in such a useful or novel way that they become enduring resources. When journalists at ProPublica wanted to explore the safety of American kidney dialysis clinics, they built http://projects.propublica.org/dialysis/[an application] that helped users check whether their hometown facility was safe. Providing such an important and relevant service creates a relationship with users that reaches far beyond what a narrative story can do alone.

Therein lies both the challenge and the promise of building cutting-edge news apps: creating something of lasting value.  Whether you are a developer or a manager, any discussion about how to build a great news app should start with a product development mentality: Keep a laser focus on the user, and work to get the most bang for your buck. So before you start building, it helps to ask yourself three questions:

**1. Who is my audience and what are their needs?**

News apps don't serve the story for its own sake – they serve the user. Depending on the project, that user might be a dialysis patient who wants to know about the safety record of her clinic, or even a homeowner unaware of earthquake hazards near his home. No matter who it is, any discussion about building a news app, like any good product, should start with the people who are going to use it.

A single app might serve many users. For instance, a project called http://curbwise.com/[Curbwise], built by the Omaha (Nebraska) World-Herald serves homeowners who believe they are being overtaxed; curious residents who are interested in nearby property values; and real estate workers trying to keep track of recent sales. In each of those cases, the app meets a specific need that keeps users coming back.

Homeowners, for instance, might need help gathering information on nearby properties so they can argue that their taxes are unfairly high. Pulling together that information is time-consuming and complicated – a problem Curbwise solves for its users by compiling a http://curbwise.com/how-to-protest[user-friendly report] of all the information they need to challenge their property taxes to local authorities. Curbwise sells that report for $20, and people pay for it because it solves a real problem in their lives.

Whether your app solves a real-world problem like Curbwise or supplements the narrative of a story with an interesting visualization, always be aware of the people who will be using it. And then concentrate on designing and building features based on their needs.

**2. How much time should I spend on this?**

Developers in the newsroom are like water in the desert: highly sought after and in short supply. Building news apps means balancing the daily needs of a newsroom against the long-term commitments it takes to build truly great products.

Say your editor comes to you with an idea: The City Council is set to have a vote next week about whether to demolish several historic properties in your town. He suggests building a simple application that allows users to see the buildings on a map.

As a developer, you have a few options. You can flex your engineering muscle by building a gorgeous map using custom software. Or you can use existing tools like Google Fusion Tables or open source mapping libraries and finish the job in a couple hours. The first option will give you a better app; but the second might give you more time to build something else with a better chance of having a lasting impact.

Just because a story lends itself to a complex, beautiful news app doesn't mean you need to build one. Balancing priorities is critical. The trick is to remember that every app you build comes at a cost: namely, another potentially more impactful app you could have been working on instead. 

**3. How can I take things to the next level?**

Building high-end news apps can be time-consuming and expensive. That's why it always pays to ask about the payoff. How do you elevate a one-hit wonder into something special?

Creating an enduring project that transcends the news cycle is one way. But so is building a tool that saves you time down the road (and open sourcing it!), or applying advanced analytics to your app to learn more about your audience.

Lots of organizations build Census maps to show demographic shifts in their cities. But when the Chicago Tribune news apps team http://media.apps.chicagotribune.com/chicago-census/less-than-five.html[built theirs], they took things to the next level by developing tools and techniques to build those maps quickly, which they then http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/2011/03/08/making-maps-1/[made available] for other organizations to use.

At my employer, the Center for Investigative Reporting, we coupled a simple searchable database with a fine-grained event tracking framework that allowed us to learn, among other things, how much users value serendipity and exploration in our news apps.

At the risk of sounding like a bean-counter, always think about http://cironline.org/blog/post/beyond-three-ps-few-more-thoughts-business-news-apps[return on investment]. Solve a generic problem; create a new way to engage users; open source parts of your work; use analytics to learn more about your users; or even find cases like Curbwise where part of your app might generate revenue.

**Wrapping up**

News application development has come a long way in a very short time. News Apps 1.0 were a lot like Infographics 2.0 – interactive data visualizations, mixed with searchable databases, designed primarily to advance the narrative of the story. Now, many of those apps can be designed by reporters on deadline using open source tools, freeing up developers to think bigger thoughts.

News Apps 2.0, where the industry is headed, is about combining the storytelling and public service strengths of journalism with the product development discipline and expertise of the technology world. The result, no doubt, will be an explosion of innovation around ways to make data relevant, interesting and especially useful to our audience – and at the same time hopefully helping journalism do the same.

=== Roles of visualisation in journalism by Lulu Pinney ===

The function of data visualisations in reportage is twofold. Firstly they are a tool for exploring the data to find where any stories are. Their second use is for telling a story. And it is worth noting that - for the same set of data - it is more than likely that the visuals best suited to finding a story will not be best suited to the telling of it.

Using visualisations to explore data is a more objective exercise, and sometimes it is appropriate to create an interface so your audience can have a go themselves. Alternatively having explored and interpreted the data yourself, you can choose just to present the stories you have found in a more subjective - or editorial - manner to your audience, with or without supporting visualisations.

=== Using data visualisation to find insights in data by Gregor Aisch (Open Knowledge Foundation) ===

Visualization is critical to data analysis. It provides a front line of attack, revealing intricate structure in data that cannot be absorbed in any other way. We discover unimagined effects, and we challenge imagined ones.

(quote by William S. Cleveland in the preface of his book 'Visualising data')

Everything is visualised
Q: When do you need to visualise a dataset to explore it and find a story? When don√î√∏Œ©t you need to?

Data by itself, consisting of bits and bytes stored in a file on a computer hard-drive, is invisible. In order to be able to see and make any sense of data, we need to visualise it. In this chapter I'm going to use a broader understanding of the term visualising, that includes even pure textual representations of data. For instance, just loading a dataset into a spreadsheet software can be considered as data visualisation. The invisible data suddenly turns into a visible 'picture' on our screen. Thus, the questions should not be whether journalists need to visualise data or not, but which kind of visualisation may be the most useful in which situation. In other words: when does it makes sense to go beyond the table visualisation.

The short answer is: almost always. Tables alone are definitely not sufficient to give us some kind of overview or big picture of a dataset. Also tables alone don't allow us to immediately identify patterns within the data. The most common example here are geographical patterns which can only be observed after visualizing data on a map. But there are also other kinds of patterns which we will see later in this chapter.

How can visualisation help us to discover a story in a dataset?
How do you go about discovering a story? What tools do you use? What √î√∏Œ©protocol√î√∏Œ© do you follow? What clues do you follow, what do you pay attention to? (lessons, tips, advice).

Well, discovering a story through visualisation is a rather big goal to start with. In fact, there is no set of rules or "protocol" that will guarantee us to discover a story. Instead, I think it makes more sense to seek for smaller chunks of knowledge, from now on called insights.

Every new visualisation is likely to give us some insights into our data. Some of those insights might be already known (but maybe not proven yet) while other insights might be completely new or even surprising to us. While some of those new insights might actually mean the beginning of a story, others could just be the result of errors in the data.

In order to make the finding of insights in data more effective, I find the following process very helpful:



Each of these steps will be discussed further in this section.

Visualise data
Visualising data is the central point of this process. Each visualisation provides a unique perspective on the dataset.

Some of the most important types of visualisations:

table - displaying the raw numbers
charts - (http://www.flickr.com/photos/amit-agarwal/3196386402/sizes/l/)
maps - displaying geographical context
graphs - displaying relations in networks

Todo:

explain the vis types in more detail (provide examples)
maybe mention a few tools which can be used for data vis.
Analyse and interpret what you see
Once you have visualized your data, the next crucial step is to learn something from the picture you created. Of course, you can't learn nothing from looking at a visualization. But you should take yourself some time to really get into what you see. We need to ask us the following questions:

What can I see in this image? Are there any patterns?
What does this mean in the context of the data?
Sometimes you might end up with visualization that, despite of eventual beauty, seem to tell you nothing of value about your data. But, again, for this process it's important that you force yourself to identify some new insights.

Document your insights and next steps
If you think of this process as a journey through the dataset, the documentation is your travel diary. It will tell you where you have traveled to, what you have seen there and how you made your decisions for your next steps. You can even start your documentation before taking the first look at the data.

In most cases when we start to work with a previously unseen dataset we are already filled up with expectations and assumptions about the data. Obviously, there is some kind of reason why we are interested that dataset. It's a good idea to start the documentation by writing down these initial thoughts. This helps us to identify our bias and reduces the risk of mis-interpretation of the data by just finding what we actually wanted to find.

I really think that the documentation is the most important step of the process; and it is also the one we're most likely to tend to skip. As you will see in the following sample session, the described process involves a lot of plotting and data wrangling. Looking at a set of 15 charts you created might be very confusing, especially after some time has passed. In fact, those charts are only valuable (to you or any other person you want to communicate your findings) if presented in the context in which they have been created.

Therefor you should take the time to document a few things while you are going to this process. The goal is not to write epic stories, but to keep notes about some really important questions:

Why have I created this chart?
What have I done to the data to create it?
What insights have I found from this chart?
You can choose whatever format is convenient to you. Every tool that allows you to insert a sequence of texts and images (like PowerPoint or Word does) is perfect.

Transform data
Naturally, with your new insights gathered from the last visualization you might have an idea of what you want to see next. You might have found some interesting pattern in the dataset which you now want to inspect in more detail.

Possible transformations are:

zoom into a. (e.g. limit to a certain time span)
filter
aggregate
outlier removal
Now the time has come where we can really move on. The good news is that we've already solved the hardest question of moving on, that is: in which direction should be move on? Remember that insight you got from the last visualization? The one you've written down in you story documentation? The next step is trying to remove this insight from our data. The theory behind this is that every insight in your data might prevent us from seeing some other insights. Removing something we already know is no problem, as long as we're keeping everything for our records. And this is what I call the transform step.

Which tools to use
Every data visualization tool available is good at something. However, here are a few requirements for choosing the right tools:

Visualisation and data wrangling should be easy and cheap. If changing parameters of the visualizations takes you hours, you won't experiment that much. That doesn't necessarily mean that you don't need to learn how to use the tool. But once you learned it, it should be really efficient.
For some reasons it makes much sense to choose a tool that covers both the data wrangling and the data visualisation issues. Separating the tasks in different tools means that you have to import and export your data very often.
The sample visualizations in the next section were created using the R, which is kind of the swiss army knife of scientific data visualisation.

Example session: making sense of US election contribution data
Examples of how to explore a dataset with a visualisation tool with a step by step description of the √î√∏Œ©protocol√î√∏Œ© followed to find the story.

Let us have look at the US Presidential Campaign Finance database which contains about 450,000 contributions to US Presidential candidates. The CSV file is 60 megabytes and way to large to handle it easily in Excel.

In the first step I will explicitly write down my initial assumptions on the FEC contributions dataset:

Obama get's the most contributions (since he's the president and has the highest popularity)
The number of donations increases as the time moves closer to election date.
Obama gets more small donations than republican candidates.
To answer the first question we need to transform the data. Instead of each single contributions we need to sum the total amounts contributed to each candidate. After visualising the results in a sorted table we can confirm our assumption that Obama would raise the most money.

Candidate	 Amount ($)
Obama, Barack	 72,453,620.39
Romney, Mitt	 50,372,334.87
Perry, Rick	 18,529,490.47
Paul, Ron	 11,844,361.96
Cain, Herman	 7,010,445.99
Gingrich, Newt	 6,311,193.03
Pawlenty, Timothy	 4,202,769.03
Huntsman, Jon	 2,955,726.98
Bachmann, Michelle	 2,607,916.06
Santorum, Rick	 1,413,552.45
Johnson, Gary Earl	 413,276.89
Roemer, Charles E. 'Buddy' III	 291,218.80
McCotter, Thaddeus G	 37,030.00
But despite of showing the minimum and maximum amounts and the order the table does not tell very much about the underlying patterns in candidate ranking. Here is another view on the data, a chart type that is called dot chart in which we can see everything that is shown in the table plus the patterns within the field. For instance, the dot chart allows us to immediately compare the distance between Obama and Romney and Romney and Perry without needing to subtract values. (Footnote: The shown dot chart was created using R. You can find links to the source codes at the end of this chapter).



Now, let us proceed with a bigger picture of the dataset. As a first step I visualised all contributed amounts over time in a simple plot. We can see that almost all donations are very very small compared to three really big outliers. Further investigation returns that these huge contribution are coming from the "Obama Victory Fund 2012" (also known as Super PAC) and were made on June 29th ($450k), September 29th ($1.5mio) and December 30th ($1.9mio).



While the contributions by Super PACs alone is undoubtedly the biggest story in the data, it might be also interesting to look beyond it. The point now is that these big contributions disturb our view on the smaller contributions coming from individuals, so we're going to remove them from the data. This transform is commonly known as outlier removal. After visualizing again, we can see that most of the donations are within the range of $10k and -$5k.



According to the contribution limits placed by the FECA individuals are not allowed to donate more than $2500 to each candidate. As we see in the plot, there are numerous donations made above that limit. In particular two big contributions in May attract our attention. It seems that they are 'mirrored' in negative amounts (refunds) June and July. Further investigation in the data reveals the following transactions:

On May 10 Stephen James Davis, San Francisco, employed at Banneker Partners (attorney), has donated $25,800 to Obama.
On May 25 Cynthia Murphy, Little Rock, employed at the Murphy Group (public relations), has donated $33,300 to Obama.
On June 15 the amount of $30,800 was refunded to Cynthia Murphy, which reduced the donated amount to $2500.
On July 8 the amount $25,800 was refunded to Stephen James Davis, which reduced the donated amount to $0.
What's interesting about these numbers? The $30,800 refunded to Cynthia Murphy equals the maximum amount individuals may give to national party committees per year. Maybe she just wanted to combine both donations in one transaction which was rejected. The $25,800 refunded to Stephen James Davis possibly equals the $30,800 minus $5000 (the contribution limit to any other political committee).

Another interesting finding in the last plot is a horizontal line pattern for contributions to Republican candidates at $5000 and -$2500. To see them in more detail, I visualised just the Republican donations. The resulting graphic is kind of the perfect example for patterns in data that would be invisible without data visualisation.



What we can see is that there are many $5000 donations to Republican candidates. In fact, a look up in the data returns that these are 1243 donations, which is only 0.3% of the total number of donations, but since those donations are evenly spread across time, the line appears. The interesting thing about the line is that donations by individuals were limited to $2500. Consequently, every dollar above that limited was refunded to the donors, which results in the second line pattern at -$2500. In contrast, the contributions to Barack Obama don't show a similar pattern.



So, it might be interesting to find out why thousands of Republican donors did not notice the donation limit for individuals. To further analyze this topic, we can have a look at the total number of $5k donations per candidate.



Of course, this is a rather distorted view since it does not consider the total amounts of donations received by each candidate. The next plot shows the percentage of $5k donations per candidate.



What learn from this
Often, such a visual analysis of a new dataset feels like an exciting journey to an unknown country. You start as a foreigner with just the data and your assumptions, but with every step you make, with every chart you render, you get new insights about the topic. Based on those insights you make decisions for your next steps and what issues are worth further investigation. As you might have seen in this chapter, this process of visualizing, analyzing and transformation of data could be repeated nearly infinitely.

Source codes for the generated graphics
All of the charts shown in this chapter were created using the wonderful and powerful software R. Created mainly as a scientific visualization tool, it is hard to find any visualization or data wrangling technique that is not already built into R. For those who are interested in how to visualise and wrangle data using R, here's the source code of the charts generated in this chapter. Also, there is a wide range of books and tutorials available.

dotchart: contributions per candidate
plot: all contributions over time
plot: contributions by authorized committees

=== When to use and when not to use visualisations to tell a story by Aron Pilhofer (New York Times) ===

////

Insert: pictures from projects

There are times when data can tell a story better than words or photos, and this is why terms like "news application" and "data visualization" have attained buzzword status in so many newsrooms of late. Also fueling interest is the bumper crop of new tools and technologies designed to help even the most technically challenged journalist turn data into a piece of visual storytelling-many of them free.

Tools like Google Fusion Tables, Many Eyes, Tableau, Dipity and others make it easier than ever to create maps, charts, graphs or even full-blown data applications that heretofore were the domain of specialists. But with the barrier to entry now barely a speed bump, the question facing journalists now less about whether you can turn your dataset into a visualization, but whether you should.

http://www.niemanlab.org/2011/10/word-clouds-considered-harmful/[Bad data visualization] is worse in many respects than none at all, but journalists have few resources (until now) available to learn the right way to approach visual storytelling.

Which is the right visualisation for your story?


Not all types of visualisations are appropriate for all data sets. When you are deciding on a visualisation, keep in mind that you are trying to tell a story and that some types of visualisations will tell that story better than others.

A map, for example, will highlight geographical distribution of a variable, but it will suppress quantitative comparisons or changes over time.
The bottom chart isn't eye candy, but it is very functional; not a single pixel is wasted. Every dot conveys information relevant to the data set, and important relationships are immediately visually evident. How much of your chart is wasted on decoration, and how much communicates information?

Maps (David)
Maps can be a powerful tool to visualize data when geographical information plays a fundamental role in the telling of the story. They can be used to overlay more than one data sets to show concepts such as areas of overlap or divergence, concentrations, etc. Further, they put data in the context of the viewer's understanding of the area and, for local maps, tap into their daily experience.

Your audience must immediately (or at least clearly) intuit the information you're presenting from the visual markers. Choosing the appropriate overlays is essential. Objects can be plotted and made clickable for more information, the size of markers can be used to indicate quantity or severity (with or without a legend), overlays or polygons can represent zones.

There are many tools that simplify the creation of maps from digital data. 
http://code.google.com/apis/maps/index.html

This classic map shows the advance and retreat of Napolean's army in Russia using width to indicate army size, color to represent direction and a sharp aesthetic to show the severity of the event. http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/posters

It's important to note that the fact that data can be mapped does not mean that it should be mapped. If location isn't central to the narrative, the presence of a map will probably be distracting. http://www.ericson.net/content/2011/10/when-maps-shouldnt-be-maps/

Graphs
There are many ways to use graphs to visualize data. Data sets that focus on pairs of information such as quantity x over time or age over height are often prime. A third piece of data can usually be shown through size or color of data points. For trending information and regular distributions, such as population over time lines can connect points. Multiple sets of relevant information can also be plotted so long as they are distinguished. This can be helpful in showing upper and lower bounds or the way in which two related quantities move together over time.

It is important to keep your target audience in mind when using graphs, more so even than most other forms of visualization. Graphs are technical things. If they aren't clear or contain extraneous information, they can lead to confusion and even viewers to drawing wrong conclusions. (This is also true of graphs that are clear, but less so.) Further, what is lacking in understanding is often overcompensated in conviction. Many misconceptions have been fueled and spread through misleading graphs, or proper graphs accompanied by misleading captions.

Charts
Charts can focus a great deal of attention on a small amount of information or used in a similar way as graphs to show relationships and trends. As with graphs, the choices made in creating the graph is service of the story is vitally important.

(Lulu) Motion Graphics is one to add to taxomony:
Motion graphics
With a tight script, well timed animations and clear explanations motion graphics serve to bring complex numbers or ideas to life, guiding your audience through the story.
http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/06/29/magazine/rivera-pitches.html[How Mariano Rivera dominates hitters]
NYT's Joe Ward, sports graphics editor, is interviewed here on the making of it, a case-study of a piece of data journalism that might have been an interactive but resulted in a narrated piece of animated graphic video:
Example 2: http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/hans_rosling_on_global_population_growth.html[The Hans Rosling video] is another good example of this type of presentation.
Example 3: Whether or not you agree with their methodology I think the Economist's http://www.economist.com/blogs/multimedia/2011/02/unrest_arab_world[Shoe-throwers' index] is a good example of using video to tell a numbers-based story. You wouldn't, or shouldn't, present this graphic as a static image. There's far too much going on. But having built up to it step by step you're left with an understanding of how and why they got to this index.

Custom Graphics and Interactives
If you have an interesting story and the requisite production skills or resources, data visualization can become a deeply artistic endeavor. As a journalist, it is important to keep an editorial eye on custom graphics and interactives to ensure they stay on story, as there is a tendency with strong creative designers or coders to move toward showcases for aesthetics or functionality. See the case studies and appendix for more on custom visualizations.

(Lulu) Agrees...
Don't be tempted to throw an uber-complex interactive interface at the audience just because you've spent days developing it. If it has led you to some good stories then it has been worthwhile, but a simpler visualisation that tells a specific story might be more appropriate for the final presentation.

Making choices about which charts to use, great overview here: http://i.imgur.com/YjWta.jpg

Interaction
(Lulu)
Depending on what you want your audience to take away, different types of interaction can be used, as illustrated by these examples:
- Story-telling: http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/07/02/business/economy/20090705-cycles-graphic.html[NYT: Turning a Corner (Economic Cycles)]
- No story, free data exploration by user: http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/HTMLDocs/dvc3/projections.html[ONS: Population Pyramids]
- Learn by having a go: BERG/BBC: http://howbigreally.com/[How big really?]

When you think you're nearly there, try out your visualisation on a handful of other people. Observe them using it, exploring it. It becomes very clear very quickly what users do and don't 'get'. If your users don't realise there's another screen to progress to, all your hard work will have been wasted. Go back and adjust your work to address the obstacles that you saw users encounter.

Examples of good use of visualisations to tell stories

=== Guardian Riot map (Farida) ===

During the summer of 2011 the UK was hit by a wave of riots (full government report here todo: find link). Politicians suggested that these actions were categorically not linked to poverty and those that did the looting were simply criminals. The Guardian newspaper played a crucial role in using data driven journalism and a range of data visualizations in telling this story, allowing for better understanding who was doing the looting and why. By using simple maps (Google Fusion Tables) they showed the location of http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/interactive/2011/aug/09/uk-riots-incident-map[confirmed riots spots] and through mashing up deprivation data with where the riots took place started debunking the main political narrative that there was no link to http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/aug/16/riots-poverty-map-suspects[poverty]. Both these examples use off the shelf visualization tools and in the second example combine location data with another data set, to start making other links. A final example worth mentioning here is the visualization the paper built around the use of social media. Again politicians had started to suggest that social media use might have to be curtailed during such troubles in future, but offering little concrete evidence that social media, Twitter in this case, played a role in encouraging people to riot. A visualization of riot related http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/aug/24/twitter-study-post-riot-plans#_[hashtags] used during this period, highlighted that Twitter was mainly used to respond to the riots rather than to organize people to go looting, with #riotcleanup showing the most significant spike during the riot period.

These three examples show three different types of data visualization used very effectively.

¬¨‚àë 	The first one a simple map highlighting where riots took place using Google Fusion Tables.
¬¨‚àë 	The second map linked to an additional data set offering a further reading of events and generating more story leads.
¬¨‚àë 	Finally by looking at twitter data, visualizing the hashtags showed that significant traffic was concerned with cleaning up after the riots rather than inciting people to riot (if you were to do this yourself, you would need to think about where you would get this data).
¬¨‚àë 	Most of these visualizations used off the shelf tools to great effect for telling important stories (quickly).

Example from Finland (Farida has contacted Petri Kola, with the request to quickly explain the story and send me the link to the vis they used) - where the first time the main Finish paper ran a DDJ story + vis was inspired by the work of the Guardian. The story highlighted election data and who the main sponsors to the main parties were. The vis was simple, but cause a buzz.

Buenos Aires Elections (HacksHackers Buenos Aires - do we need a further elaboration on this example or possibly replace it with something else?)
http://elecciones2011.hhba.info/ Google Fusion Tables, scrapping data in Real time, created a platform in real time and then we sended code to embed to diferent medias.

=== When is a visualisation good and when is it bad? ===

A good visualisation clarifies, explains, reveals or adds meaning. It makes the audience say 'ah-ha, I get it'. They take away with them the story you set out to tell.

A good visualisation can turn bad however if no-one sees it, or knows how to use it. In both cases your time and effort will have been wasted. Design and UX can help solve this.

If a visualisation confuses or misleads then it is bad, regardless of how pretty or user-friendly it might be. It still has to be good journalism, even if it is visual.

In reality most visualisations add little over and above what you can just write in words or say into a microphone. When presented side by side they are not wasted: saying the same thing two different ways plays to the fact that every audience is made up of a mix of both visual and verbal people. However since visualisations such as these have the potential to work harder it is a shame not to have made them do so.

It is in a big middle-ground of OK-ness that most visualisations lurk. And the two things that will elevate a visualisation from being OK to good is knowing your story and knowing your audience. Use both of these, from the outset, to inform your decisions and the resulting visualisation stands every chance of being a great one.

How do you use design language to illuminate meaning in a concise way? (Just ask Tufte!)
Colour: use colour sparingly to highlight information that is more important than others, or show the distinction between two sets of variables. Choose colours that are distinct enough that colourblind individuals are able to read your visualization, and don't use extra colours or patterns unnecessarily.

snook.ca: Allows you to check colour contrast of a foreground colour against a different background colour: http://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html
Grid lines: grid lines do not add important information to your chart; remove them, and ask yourself if the chart still communicates its message as effectively. If you must use them, make sure they are as visually minimal as possible


(Lulu)
Typography: Complement the story's hierarchy with a visual hierarchy:


- make the title both big and insightful
- label key points directly and bold them up
- hand-hold the user through the structure of the story by distinguishing header text from body text
2D v.s. 3D: Never, ever use 3D graphs. They distract from information and add nothing.


(Lulu)
Sound and Motion: Primarily leading to motion graphics, a massively growing field. Simultaneously reinforcing what your audience is hearing from a voice-over with explanatory visuals provides a very powerful and memorable way of telling a story.
Layout: Size, position, white space are the variables you have to play with. As a rule of thumb adjust these so the design works for the extreme cases - longest labels, most data, biggest sample, and their smallest counterparts too. Then the rest should all fall into line.
Keys (or legends): Avoid using them whenever possible. It's much more effective to label lines, points, bars directly. If you do have to use a key, put it at the top, in a prominent position.
Platform: Design for the platform that your visualisation is going to live on. If both print and online, re-design it to work on the other one. A print graphic directly uploaded to a website rarely works as well as it could online, and vice versa of course. It's almost always necessary to re-work.

Visualizing the data
News journalism is about bringing new information as fast as possible to the reader. The fastest way may be a video, a photo, a text, a graph, a table or a combination of the different methods. 
Concerning visualizations, the purpose should be the same: Quick information. The introduction of new data tools has given journalists the possibilities of making stories they could not do without them, new possibilities to find stories and new ways of presenting them. 
Here are some examples showing how data visualization is used in the most read newspaper in Norway, Verdens Gang (VG).

**1. When the visualization is the story:**
 
Translation: Here is crime happening - hour by hour
Link: http://www.vgtv.no/#!id=46131

In this animated heatmap combined with a simple bar chart you can follow the development of crime downtown Oslo, Norway, hour by hour, during the weekend for several months. In the same animated heatmap, you can see the number of police officers working at the same time. When crime really is happening, the number of police officers is at the bottom.
Tools used: ArcView with Spatial Analyst.


**2. When the visualization helps us finding the story:**
 

Translation: The network of the movie people
Skuespillere = actors/actresses
Regiss‚àö‚àèrer = directors
In this Social Network Analysis, VG downloaded all relations in all Norwegian movies during more than ten years. Who were playing with whom, and which actors and actresses were playing with the different directors? A database with all relevant content was exported to UCINET, a program for social network analysis, and then it was quite easy to see who were connected with whom with different strength of ties. 
. 
Translation: Rich children are playing together
The same methods were used when downloading 157 friendlists from Facebook. These 157 people were sons and daughters of the richest people in Norway, and the social network analysis was showing that heirs of the richest persons in Norway also herited their parents' network.
Tools used: Access, Excel Notepad, Ucinet.
Before publication, the designer downloaded the Ucinet illustration file as a JPG-file and used it as a background when working in Adobe Illustrator. There all is handmade, before the finish in Adoble Photoshop. 

Lessons learned: When making social network analysis, we get an enormous amount of data. When making the presentation, we have to do manual work at the end; make some choices. 
Anecdotes: The most central person in the movie network denied there was a network!


**3. When the visualization is telling the story:**
 
Translation: Out of the ghetto.
Pakistanis of the middle class are moving out of downtown Oslo
These mapping examples are showing the intern migration in Oslo, based upon data from The Norwegian Bureau of Statistics. The angle for the story is the development among the biggest immigration groups in Oslo, and the reader does not have to read the text to understand the news. 
Tools used: Excel, Access, ArcView.
Lessons learned: Too much text on the pages. It would have been better to concentrate 100 percent on the graphs.

**4. When the visualization is supplying the text:**
 
Translation: Erna is the queen of the applauses
Antall ord = the number of words
Vokabular = vocabulary
Setningslengde = length of periods
Ord pr. minutt = words pronounced each minute
Link: http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/valg-2009/artikkel.php?artid=570321

This visualization is based upon text mining of the speeches held by the seven Norwegian party leaders during their Conventions. All speeches were analyzed, and the analyses gave the angles to make some stories. Every story was linking to the graph, and the readers could play around, studying the language of the politicians.
Tools used: Excel, Access, Flash and Illustrator.
Lessons learned: In 2012 we would have made the interactive graph in Javascrips.
We do not yet have good tools for text mining.

**5. When the visualization is an integrated part:**
 
Translation: Mekka of the slots in the north (of Norway)
This story is about the use of slots in the different parts of Norway. The text, the tables, the graph and the photo are all parts of an integrated solution.
Tools used: Most important was Access database. The mapping solution is made in ArcView.



**6. When the graphs are interactive:**

 
Translation: Here people are using most of their income on Lotto
Link: http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=569832


This story is based upon a database containing data from the Norwegian Bureau of Statistics, taxpayers data and data from the national Lotto monopolist. In this interactive graph, the reader could find different kind of information from each Norwegian county and municipality. The actual table is showing the percent of the income used on games.
Tools used: Access, Excel, MySql, Flash


 
Translation:
Poeng landet har gitt = points given.
Poeng landet f‚àö‚Ä¢r = points received.
Differanse mellom gir og f‚àö‚Ä¢r = the difference between what you give and what you get.
Poeng mottatt ‚àö‚Ä¢r for ‚àö‚Ä¢r = points received each year.
MGP vinner ‚àö‚Ä¢r for ‚àö‚Ä¢r = the winner each year.
LILIANA:
Link DEAD AT THE MOMENT. WE COULD REACTIVATE IT IF YOU WANT TO.


After downloading all points given in The Eurovision Song Contest from 1994 to 2009 into a database, VG made this interactive graph, documenting who is voting for whom. In this interactivity of entertainment, the reader could click at each country to get all information interesting him or her.
Tools used: Access, Excel, MySql, Flash


 
Translation of the column titles: Pristilskudd = price given by the dairy.
Produksjonstilskudd = national subsidies
Link: http://www.vg.no/spesial/jordbrukstilskudd/

The data in this table is containing farm subsidies to all Norwegian farmers, some 46 000. By clicking at the drop down menu at the top of the graph, the readers could choose county and municipality.
Tools used: Access, Excel, MySql.
Lessons learned: This table and the stories connected to it was the most read that day. The graphs do not necessarily need to be fancy to capture readers.

**7. When the visualization is user-generated:**
 
Translation: Here people is most afraid in Oslo
Link: http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=10091789

This Google heat map is based upon information given by 16 000 readers. There had been several rapes downtown Oslo, and the readers could click at a Google map to show were in Oslo they did not feel safe.
Tools used: Google Fusion Tables with heatmap, Google maps, MySql. 

Do not give them all!
So; when do we need to visualize a story? Most of the times we do not need to do it, but sometimes we have to do so to help the readers. Stories containing a huge number of data quite often need visualization. However, we have to be quite critical when choosing what kind of data we are going to present. OK, we know everything about the stuff, but what kind of basic information does the reader really need to know? Perhaps a table is enough, or a simple graph showing a development from year A to year C.
When working with data journalism, the point is not necessarily to present huge amounts of data. The data gives us, as reporters, the possibilities to make stories we could not do without our data knowledge. It's all about journalism!
Like a good picture
A clear trend the last 2-3 years has been to create interactive graphs and tables, and then the reader has the possibility to go into the debth of the themes. 
A good visualization is like a good picture: You understand what it is about just by looking on it a moment or two. When starting to study the picture, or the graph, you see and enjoy more and more of the details.
The visualization is bad when the reader does not know where to start or where to stop, and when the visualization is overloaded by details. Perhaps a long text had been better?
The question of quality is also a platform question. A perfect and big print visualization can not be automatically adopted to the web or the smart phone platforms. But that is another discussion.

=== Data-driven apps case studies - Internews in Kenya by Mark Irungu (Internews Network) ===

////

Insert: ask liliana for images for this case study

////



On the 6th of July 2011, the Kenya government became the first in Africa to have an open data portal to the public. Making government data open is not a very popular idea that regimes would readily embrace in Africa, not with the rampant corruption and mismanagement of public funds. Understandably, the Kenyan Government has received a lot of accolades for that. 


While this World Bank supported initiative received a lot of praise globally (from the New York Times to government heads in the developed world) the scenario was different locally. It was great news in the techie world but just another tiny story in the world of journalism. The story was not covered beyond the day of the launch. Few journalists visited portal after the launch! The data is accessible online and just like all data sets; it is not in the smallest way friendly to the eye, at least not a journalist's eye.

The GAP

Whereas the techies have taken the idea and ran with it, trying to think of apps that could be developed to mine the data, clean the data and visualize it making it more accessible to people beyond the developer community.. 
A new digital divide exists, not just in Kenya between journalists and developers in working with Open Data. Journalists need to learn more on the mechanics of using data. Developers, also called techies, also have a lot to learn. . Developers may be brilliant with code, but have a lot to learn with regard to content, the opposite is true for journalists. Why not leverage these strengths to form a 'tag team'? They do not necessarily have to be at the same place at the same time, all we need is an interface co connect them. What the data world needs is a good app that can serve these groups..

The APP

The power of data cannot be under estimated. It is time that newsrooms and journalists moved away from the "he said, she said" reporting. Numbers don't lie, they can help journalists produce in-depth features, and explore untold stories and trends that are not immediately known or visible to the general public.. Unfortunately, journalists in Kenya have not made good use of the opened data. I work at Internews in Kenya - a media development organisation that trains and supports journalists to be better storytellers, In our journalism workshops we have designed a number of courses to help journalists use numbers and data better for their storytelling. This is important as it helps journalists to enrich their enquiry and stories 

It is with this realization that the idea of developing an app to query KODI was born. There is need for a a solution that would help journalists clean up raw data in the back end and help journalist to identify emerging stories and trends.That app should also help in presenting the content in visually appealing ways. 

The app should:
1. Query the entire Kenya open data portal.
2. Clean the data/ provide a friendly interface for cleaning the data.
3. Visualize the data.
4. Generate reports that can be used as is.



The Target

We are facing a unique scenario. Who were we targeting? We have had to determine whether this is going to be a case of old hands, new tricks or new hands, new tricks. Traditional journalism has undergone a radical evolution process with the coming in of web 2.0. Maybe that was enough. Yes there is a significant gap between journalists and techies, but we have also established that the desire to among journalists to learn and possibly close this gap is very strong . The 'evolved' traditional journalist has been showing willingness to undergo a second metamorphosis and the upcoming journalist doesn't mind this baptism of fire. The app we are working will serve journalists at all levels.

The Team and the Technology

Over the past 8 years, Internews has worked in Kenya with journalists to build capacity in health and conflict sensitive reporting through training, mentoring, travel grants and availing resources for journalists at the Nairobi and Eldoret offices. The idea of developing an APP has come hand in hand with the idea of setting up a Center for Digital journalism at the Kenya office. This center does more or less what Internews has been doing but at a digital scale. The center also 'incubates' upcoming and evolving data/ digital journalists and has facilities that aid such journalists in production of complex and compelling stories.

To develop this app, we have had to face the fact that we do not know everything and we needed to talk to those who may have taken our path before leveraging on our relationship with various developer communities in Nairobi to form a team that would work towards our end product. Our first choice approach was the use of PHP ZEND framework and ADOBE flex and flash builder 4.5 for php. We initially felt these platforms would be sufficient to start us off. However, along the way we have picked up on other technologies that we believe will spice up the end result e.g. the DATA journalism developer studio running on open Linux. The tool will run across all platforms; web, desktop, mobile. With the high uptake and use of mobile phones in Kenya, it is Important that all Open data tools should be able to run on mobile platforms (J2ME, Android).

Developers vary in coding strengths and language preferences. After determining which languages our platform would run on, we have had to identify strong team members that would deliver the quality of code that would make this world-class product. We have also distinguished those working on the front end (user experience) and those working on the back end (dirty work). The two teams have to sync at the application level and there is need for a strong working relationship.



Kenya has clearly made some bold steps but there is still a lot of ground to cover. 
The biggest challenge is not coming up with the idea but in having a worthy team. An outcome based approach team that endears its energies to the overall objective makes product successful. If used well, Data can be life changing. Electoral dynamics especially in voting patterns in Kenya have been devoid of content and objectivity. With available data, this and many other systems in Kenya can change for the better. 


**2. How to build a news app**

A news app is a software (web, desktop, mobile,ussd) that acts as an interface between the database layer of the information architecture and the client side. News apps make data friendlier to the client as compared to the format and layout at the storage engine. 

News Apps vary in type:

1.	Curation- This is an app that gathers already existing information and brings it to one platform based on a particular keyword(s). This kind of app may not necessarily have its own storage engine, some depend on a 'Google type' indexing mechanism that crawls the net and indexes searchable information. Examples of Curation APPS; Storify, Storyful.

2.	News Portals- these are online news portals that deliver news in real time. News websites, news applications running on mobile platforms , aggregated feed readers fall in this category


3.	Citizen reporting- these are apps whose main source of data is the citizen. These apps provide an interface for citizen-journalism and then visualize the data graphically or on a map. E.g.: Ushahidi, crowdmap, swiftriver

4.	DATA apps - These are apps that query DATA sets from governments, organizations, civil society etc. These Apps may have their own storage engine that is updated regularly from the main data source e.g. World Bank finances, Kenya open data. Examples of such applications: CDF monitor (Kenya) Internews Open DATA app(Kenya)



Why and for who?
News Apps are not for journalists only. Most news apps are coded to produce interactive and friendly reports that can be used by any news savvy person. The act of interacting with a news app looking for news is in itself journalism. Newsrooms, News organizations, governments, and civil society should commission development of news apps based on need.

In the age of Open Source tools, re-inventing the wheel is not necessary. When making the decision to develop a news app, it is imperative to survey the current news landscape and identify tools that do at least half of what you'd like to see. Chances are that in most instances you may just combine two different tools with great precision. For example, when working on large data sets you may be looking for a tool that will clean the data and also visualize it in clean interactive graphs, charts, bubbles and possibly maps. You may want, in this instance, to clean the data on Google refine, and then export the data to Tile Mill to visualize it on a map and to infogr.am to plot it on a matrix! 

However, there are rare scenarios like that of Kenya where relationships between datasets need to be established on the fly in order to generate some visualizations that may require you to develop an app altogether. This saves the non-techie journalist the hustle e.g. of trying to join a table with all constituencies in Kenya with another with their Longitude and latitude co-ordinates in order to plot the info on a map.

The main idea of developing a news app should be motivated by the need to make data friendlier. If your news app does not make your numbers sexy/savvy then it's not worth the time. And money! 

A good news app should:

1. Mine the data- extracting data sets from the source.
2. Clean the data- pick out anomalies in the data and highlight them to the user. The user then corrects the anomalies.
3. Export data- have export data functionality.
4. Visualize the data

Open source apps have indeed made things easier for all of us; the ability to even alter the source code of a free product release under the GPNU license is particularly enticing. It is however important to apply news apps to the context for which they were developed and not to the context that cuts costs for you as a news organization. 

A classical example is the USHAHIDI platform; Ushahidi was built mainly for crisis citizen reporting. It worked perfect during the post election violence in Kenya and mapping of hotspots, and even better during the Haiti earthquake and the BP oil spill. But it stops working when used for activities that do not engage citizens to report e.g. mapping out country offices of an organization. 


Packaging 
 
The success or failure of an app is strongly dependent on how it is packaged. Packaging in this case refers mainly to the platforms for which it is built. Developers should aim at presenting very flexible and useable apps. Limiting an APP to one operating system e.g. windows is a big setback and significantly contributes to the failure of the app.

To counter such issues, developers are encouraged to come up with fully functional online versions of applications before thinking of the desktop app. An online app only locks out someone without a browser! Desktop versions and mobile versions should be added features and not the other way round.


Resources

Having powerful computers, big screens, servers and test platforms is a good thing when developing a news app, having good human resources is even better. The skill set required in this case is unique: a combination of UX, backend and security is required. Developers should take advantage and participate in online communities, developer meet ups, hackerthons, workshops and boot camps to sharpen their skills. Technology, just like traditional journalism, is constantly evolving and every developer should work with this realization. Laxity is not an option

=== Needs A Title by Duncan Geere (Wired.co.uk) ===

Almost as important as publishing the data in the first place is getting reaction from your audience. You're human - you're going to make mistakes, miss things and get the wrong idea from time to time. Your audience is one of the most useful assets that you've got -- they can fact-check and point out things that you may not have considered.

Engaging that audience is tricky, though. You're dealing with a group of people who've been conditioned over years of internet use to hop from site to site, leaving nothing but a sarcastic comment in their wake. Building a level of trust between you and your users is crucial -- they need to know what they're going to get, know how they can react to it and offer feedback, and know that that feedback is going to be listened to.

But first you need to think about what audience you've got, or want to get. That will both inform and be informed by the kind of data that you're working with -- if it's specific to a particular sector, then you're going to want to explore particular communications with that sector. Are there trade bodies that you can get in touch with, that will be willing to publicise the resources that you've got and the work that you've done to a wider audience? Is there a community website or a messageboard that you can get in touch with?

Social media is an important tool, too, though it again depends on the type of data that you're working with. If you're looking at global shipping statistics, for example, you're unlikely to find a group on Facebook or Twitter that'll be especially interested in your work. On the other hand if you're sifting through corruption indices across the world, or local crime statistics, that's likely to be something that's going to be of interest to a rather wider audience.

Then you need to think about how those people are going to interact with your work. Sure, they might read the story that you've written and look at the infographics or maps, but giving your users an outlet to respond is immensely valuable. More than anything it's likely to give you greater insight into the subject you're writing about, informing future work on the topic.

It goes without saying that you need to publish the raw data alongside your articles, but think about if there's other ways that you can get the audience to interact. Keep an eye on metrics on which parts of your datasets are getting attention -- it's likely that the most trafficked areas could have something to say that you might have missed.

Think beyond the comment box, too. Can you attach comments to particular cells in a spreadsheet? Or a particular region of an infographic? Make sure that other users can see those comments too -- they have almost as much value as the original data, in a lot of cases.

Finally, other people might want to publish their own infographics and stories on the same sources of data -- think about how best to tie that information together. You could use a hashtag specific to the dataset, for example, or if it's highly pictorial then you could share it in a Flickr group. Having a route to share information more confidentially could be useful too -- in some cases it might not be safe for people to publicly share their contributions to a dataset, or they might simply not be comfortable doing so.

=== Public Data goes Social by Full Name Here ===

Data is invaluable. To the uninformed person where information asymmetry thrives, access to data illuminates the path to facts and provokes emotions that trigger results. Nevertheless, poor handling of data puts valuable facts in an opaque structure that communicates nothing. Data could be in a maze of thick document riddled with complex terms or iterations of figures that doesn't connect the user.  Not being able to promote discussion nor give provide contextual understanding, data may could be worthless. 

Nigeria returned to democracy in 1999 after lengthy years of military rule. Data under the barrel of the gun was an exclusive preserve of rulers as probing the facts behind data is taken as an affront to authority and strive to question the stained reputation of the junta. Civil servants were bound by the Official Secrets Act not to share government information hereby putting the citizens in the dark. Even after thirteen years of return to democracy, there is clearly a gap in accessing public data with some government officials still stricken with military era hangover. Data especially in terms of public expenditure communicates little to the larger sections of public who are not versed in financial accounting nor have requisite understanding to evaluate the complex arithmetic. 

BudgIT, creative startup sees a huge opportunity in using creative data visualization to stimulate interests concerning public expenditure. Understanding the ubiquity of the mobile device within the Nigerian locality and the increasing number of Nigerians online, BudgIT sees the opportunity to engage Nigerians and explain public expenditure in a simpler way. This thrives on building engagement across all platforms, encouraging the community to action via NGOs and reaching out to everyone to promote citizen participation. This is about making public data a social object and building an extensive network that demands change. 

*Building The Community*

Across our interactions with users, we see a gulf in understanding what the budget is and what the citizens usually expect. We have engaged over 10,000 Nigerians over the budget and we profile them into three to ensure optimum value is delivered. The categories are briefly explained below: 

*Singular Users*:  These are users who want information in simple and quick format. There are interested in data but not in a deeper scale of analyzing the content or probing further. A series of simple tweets is enough for them to retell the stories or interactive applications that give a snapshot. 

*Closed Loop Users*:  A set of  users who stimulate a discussion pattern, engage the data channel effectively to increase their knowledge of subject matter or  challenge the assumptions of data. These set of users are adherents of the platform via social media, hence they ensure in building the platform through feedack systems or referral to their social connections. 

*The Data Hog*: This set of users want the raw datasets to rework visualization or do extensive analysis for personal or enterprise purposes. We simply give them the data for their definitive purposes.  


*Engaging the Citizen*

Across every society lies a literacy span and engaging every component is highly critical to the societal growth and stability. There is always a storyboard in every life that volumes of data can be matched with. People constantly want to be more informed especially concerning issues that they find difficult to understand. Engaging citizens is to take critical analysis of the target users at a time and itemize the possible profiles. A look at user profile demands a thorough analysis of their empathy, attention and insight towards the data available to them. What does the Nigerian citizen care about? Where is the information gap? How quickly can we reach out to them and place data in the storyboard of their lives? A critical understanding of the user's psychology and the perceived response to the data is the first needed level of analysis. BudgIT's immediate reach is to the average literate Nigerian connected to online forums and social media. Most online users amidst the array of interests in gaming, reading and sharing social connections within a limited timeframe will definitely need data in a brief and concise manner. After a snapshot of data  either as a tweet or infographics, there's an opportunity to build linked data on other platforms where the big picture can be set and interaction can be enhanced.  

An important angle of visualization to us is understanding the data appreciation level of the users. Complex diagrams, superb infographics and aesthetic interactive applications might not convey the exact meaning to user based on his/her previous approach to data. Data vizualization needs to take into consideration how users can easily grasp the vizualized data and subject it to personal interpretation. A good visualization transfers knowledge and mostly important brings forth a story the user can easily connect with. 

For us in BudgIT, our engagement model is anchored on the following: 

*Stimulating discussion around Trends*: In engaging with users on public data, BudgIT keeps track of online and offline discussions and seeks to provide data to enliven the interactions. A glaring example was the fuel strikes in January 2012 where there was a constant agitation among the protesters on the need to reduce the size of governance. BudgIT tracking the discussion via social media in 36 active hours quickly built an app that allows citizens to cut the Nigerian budget. The huge response with over 3,000 users who interacted with the budget using the app refined our  engagement model. We keep looking for trends in the polity and matching it with relevant data quickly rendered into tweets or infographic display that quickly  extends our influence. 

*Constructive feedback mechanism and Balanced outlook*: Data speaks volumes and individuals subject it to personal interpretations. In the engagement with users, feedback is enabled through discussion boards or retweets. Most users throw up discussions that tend to ask about stories behind the data and seeking opinions of BudgIT. Its of utmost priority to ensure that opinions only explain the facts  behind the data and does not conform to individual disposition to the subject matter. It's most necessary to build up feedback channels and engage the users creatively to ensure the community built around the data is sustained. 

*Localize Outlook of Data*: For a dataset targeted at a particular group, BudgIT is building competency to localize its content and promote a channel of discussion that connects to the users. This involves taking a cultural outlook at the icons, symbols, objects and language to ensure that engagement concerning the budget flows seamlessly. This phase of engagement is with the grassroots who  mostly don't have access to Internet but only possess SMS-based mobile phones. 

After making the public expenditure data  available in an easy-to-read format as shown on our portal yourbudgit.com, we reach out to the citizens through the civil society organizations to ensure that citizens monitor capital projects in the budget. We also plan to develop a participatory framework where citizens and government institutions can meet in town halls to define key items in the budget that needs to be prioritized. Once we get citizens to be aware of capital projects in the budget and connect them with civil societies where BudgIT is not located, citizens can track report projects and report status. Ensuring that citizens of any literacy span are armed with data and possess a clear path to demand action, BudgIT is crossing the rubicon from open data to open action.

Journalism demands engagement with the public. This is a feature since the first newspapers that also influenced the creation of nation-states in the 17th century. At that time readers identified themselves with each other because at least they shared similar culture, imaginary, language and community interests. Whether this interaction is now through text, audio, audiovisual, animation or any other new visualization processes, trust and transparency are still crucial among journalists and citizen stakeholders.
Much before having any kind of communication technology our civilization were founded on storytelling and connection among people. A story is relevant as far as the audiences feel represented on it. But it took us centuries to improve the ways to bring people, and nations, closer to each other in a global - and almost apt to be scrutinized - scene. But the challenge still resides on experimenting emerging principles and practice of citizen engagement on inclusive journalistic perspectives to foster information access and popular participation.
Preparing and implementing editorial products based on datasets include as well participating on social conversations and considering user-centred design of information to better achieve citizen involvement. There are innovative ways to monitor feedbacks and civic participation on the social web and to encourage the creation of environments for dialog and social innovation.
A news professional might be prepared to attend the demands of the public and influence their capacity to act alongside their peers. The more people take ownership of these communication resources; greater are the reflections of the journalistic efforts in the everyday of society and vice versa.
Despite of being able to create data-driven journalism applications and services that are representative and able for accomplishing social improvements, the role of journalists is also enhance the social inclusion and education. A decisive way to do this is collaborate with the approach between the civic society stakeholders and the practitioners or researchers of ICT's into human-centred outlooks.
The multidisciplinarity common to the variety of editorial sections of journalism has always collaborated with the interrelationship among different domains. When drawing or implementing strategies and plans consider leveraging opportunities and providing the knowledge and the skills to warrant inclusiveness, diversity and innovation in our societies. Make sure your project contributes to empower people through technology and/or media literacy.
If only by consuming or sharing news, the public is involved in modeling of information systems. Therefore, it is necessary to provide the best resources for collaboration and joint construction of stories. There is a growing emergence of examples that stand out in this foray:

http://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/introducing-docdiver[DocDiver] is an application to stimulate readers on working beside ProPublica investigative reporters' team to identify and share key bits of information in documents.

http://www.documentcloud.org/home[DocumentCloud] is preparing a new feature to engage readers in discussing and crowdsourcing news by allowing them to add their own notes and comments to material collected and displayed.

http://www.ft.com/intl/eu-funds[EUfunds] is collaboration between the Financial Times and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism to help readers on tracking European Union structural funds.

https://www.drumbeat.org/en-US/journalism/about/[MoJo] is the Knight-Mozilla partnership to bring together technologists and journalists in developing innovative solutions.

http://www.a24media.com/whatsyourstory/[Africa: What's Your Story] is a collaborative platform of the citizen news agency A24Media to implicate people from across the continent on sharing information about media freedom, corruption, health, education and other issues in video, text and audio.

The collaborative ways of treating or recirculating information and the bias for popular mobilizations are already means for important changes in this recent world of new media, big data sources and participatory culture. Even if only around 30 percent of the world population was online by the end 2010 (source: http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/publications/idi/2011/index.html[2011 ITU report]), there are space for commitment to spread the principles of freedom and to share experiences, best practice and opportunities to improve the capability of citizens and other stakeholders to write/interact/play/sense the next chapters of the history of press.
