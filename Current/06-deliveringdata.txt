=== Put Your Data Online (Various Contributors) ===

Increasingly news organisations are putting datasets that they work with online for readers to explore and reuse. In this chapter data journalists tell us how to do it, and what the results are.

  * Tools and technologies for publishing data (Google Spreadsheets vs. Tableau vs. roll your own)
  * Explicitly enabling others to reuse data using an open license / legal tool
  * Linking or embedding data
  * Who is interested in data?
  * How do people engage with data? Commenting? Flagging?
  * How have people reused data that you've published in unexpected ways.

*To Visualise or Not to Visalise?*

[quote, Aaron Pilhofer (New York Times)]
____
There are times when data can tell a story better than words or photos, and this is why terms like ``news application'' and ``data visualization'' have attained buzzword status in so many newsrooms of late. Also fueling interest is the bumper crop of new tools and technologies designed to help even the most technically challenged journalist turn data into a piece of visual storytelling-many of them free.

Tools like Google Fusion Tables, Many Eyes, Tableau, Dipity and others make it easier than ever to create maps, charts, graphs or even full-blown data applications that heretofore were the domain of specialists. But with the barrier to entry now barely a speed bump, the question facing journalists now less about whether you can turn your dataset into a visualization, but whether you should.

http://www.niemanlab.org/2011/10/word-clouds-considered-harmful/[Bad data visualization] is worse in many respects than none at all, but journalists have few resources (until now) available to learn the right way to approach visual storytelling.

*Which is the Right Visualisation for Your Story?*

[quote, Lulu Pinney (?? need to check this) (BBC)]
____
Not all types of visualisations are appropriate for all data sets. When you are deciding on a visualisation, keep in mind that you are trying to tell a story and that some types of visualisations will tell that story better than others.

A map, for example, will highlight geographical distribution of a variable, but it will suppress quantitative comparisons or changes over time. The bottom chart isn't eye candy, but it is very functional; not a single pixel is wasted. Every dot conveys information relevant to the data set, and important relationships are immediately visually evident. How much of your chart is wasted on decoration, and how much communicates information?
____

*Maps*

[quote, (?? need to check this)]
____
Maps can be a powerful tool to visualize data when geographical information plays a fundamental role in the telling of the story. They can be used to overlay more than one data sets to show concepts such as areas of overlap or divergence, concentrations, etc. Further, they put data in the context of the viewer's understanding of the area and, for local maps, tap into their daily experience.

Your audience must immediately (or at least clearly) intuit the information you're presenting from the visual markers. Choosing the appropriate overlays is essential. Objects can be plotted and made clickable for more information, the size of markers can be used to indicate quantity or severity (with or without a legend), overlays or polygons can represent zones.

It's important to note that the fact that data can be mapped http://www.ericson.net/content/2011/10/when-maps-shouldnt-be-maps/[does not mean that it should be mapped]. If location isn't central to the narrative, the presence of a map will probably be distracting.
____

*Using Motion Graphics*
[quote, (?? need to check this - possibly Lu Lu?)]
____

With a tight script, well timed animations and clear explanations motion graphics can serve to bring complex numbers or ideas to life, guiding your audience through the story. Hans Rosling's video lectures are a good example of how data can come to life to tell a story on the screen. Whether or not you agree with their methodology I also think the Economist's http://www.economist.com/blogs/multimedia/2011/02/unrest_arab_world[Shoe-throwers' index] is a good example of using video to tell a numbers-based story. You wouldn't, or shouldn't, present this graphic as a static image. There's far too much going on. But having built up to it step by step you're left with an understanding of how and why they got to this index.
____

There's also:

____
Sound and Motion: Primarily leading to motion graphics, a massively growing field. Simultaneously reinforcing what your audience is hearing from a voice-over with explanatory visuals provides a very powerful and memorable way of telling a story.
____

*When is a visualisation good and when is it bad?*

____
A good visualisation clarifies, explains, reveals or adds meaning. It makes the audience say 'ah-ha, I get it'. They take away with them the story you set out to tell.

A good visualisation can turn bad however if no-one sees it, or knows how to use it. In both cases your time and effort will have been wasted. Design and UX can help solve this.

If a visualisation confuses or misleads then it is bad, regardless of how pretty or user-friendly it might be. It still has to be good journalism, even if it is visual.

In reality most visualisations add little over and above what you can just write in words or say into a microphone. When presented side by side they are not wasted: saying the same thing two different ways plays to the fact that every audience is made up of a mix of both visual and verbal people. However since visualisations such as these have the potential to work harder it is a shame not to have made them do so.

It is in a big middle-ground of OK-ness that most visualisations lurk. And the two things that will elevate a visualisation from being OK to good is knowing your story and knowing your audience. Use both of these, from the outset, to inform your decisions and the resulting visualisation stands every chance of being a great one.

=== How to Build a News App (Chase Davis, Center for Investigative Reporting) ===

image::Figures/06-AA.png[width=600]

News applications are windows into the data behind a story. They might be searchable databases, sleek visualisations or something else altogether. But no matter what form they take, news apps encourage readers to interact with data in a context that is meaningful to them: looking up crime trends in their area, checking the safety records of their local doctor, or searching political contributions to their candidate of choice. 

More than just high-tech infographics, the best news apps are durable products. They live outside the news cycle, often by helping readers solve real-world problems, or answering questions in such a useful or novel way that they become enduring resources. When journalists at ProPublica wanted to explore the safety of American kidney dialysis clinics, they built http://projects.propublica.org/dialysis/[an application] that helped users check whether their hometown facility was safe. Providing such an important and relevant service creates a relationship with users that reaches far beyond what a narrative story can do alone.

Therein lies both the challenge and the promise of building cutting-edge news apps: creating something of lasting value.  Whether you are a developer or a manager, any discussion about how to build a great news app should start with a product development mentality: Keep a laser focus on the user, and work to get the most bang for your buck. So before you start building, it helps to ask yourself three questions:

**1. Who is my audience and what are their needs?**

News apps don't serve the story for its own sake – they serve the user. Depending on the project, that user might be a dialysis patient who wants to know about the safety record of her clinic, or even a homeowner unaware of earthquake hazards near his home. No matter who it is, any discussion about building a news app, like any good product, should start with the people who are going to use it.

A single app might serve many users. For instance, a project called http://curbwise.com/[Curbwise], built by the Omaha (Nebraska) World-Herald serves homeowners who believe they are being overtaxed; curious residents who are interested in nearby property values; and real estate workers trying to keep track of recent sales. In each of those cases, the app meets a specific need that keeps users coming back.

Homeowners, for instance, might need help gathering information on nearby properties so they can argue that their taxes are unfairly high. Pulling together that information is time-consuming and complicated – a problem Curbwise solves for its users by compiling a http://curbwise.com/how-to-protest[user-friendly report] of all the information they need to challenge their property taxes to local authorities. Curbwise sells that report for $20, and people pay for it because it solves a real problem in their lives.

Whether your app solves a real-world problem like Curbwise or supplements the narrative of a story with an interesting visualisation, always be aware of the people who will be using it. And then concentrate on designing and building features based on their needs.

**2. How much time should I spend on this?**

Developers in the newsroom are like water in the desert: highly sought after and in short supply. Building news apps means balancing the daily needs of a newsroom against the long-term commitments it takes to build truly great products.

Say your editor comes to you with an idea: The City Council is set to have a vote next week about whether to demolish several historic properties in your town. He suggests building a simple application that allows users to see the buildings on a map.

As a developer, you have a few options. You can flex your engineering muscle by building a gorgeous map using custom software. Or you can use existing tools like Google Fusion Tables or open source mapping libraries and finish the job in a couple hours. The first option will give you a better app; but the second might give you more time to build something else with a better chance of having a lasting impact.

Just because a story lends itself to a complex, beautiful news app doesn't mean you need to build one. Balancing priorities is critical. The trick is to remember that every app you build comes at a cost: namely, another potentially more impactful app you could have been working on instead. 

**3. How can I take things to the next level?**

Building high-end news apps can be time-consuming and expensive. That's why it always pays to ask about the payoff. How do you elevate a one-hit wonder into something special?

Creating an enduring project that transcends the news cycle is one way. But so is building a tool that saves you time down the road (and open sourcing it!), or applying advanced analytics to your app to learn more about your audience.

Lots of organizations build Census maps to show demographic shifts in their cities. But when the Chicago Tribune news apps team http://media.apps.chicagotribune.com/chicago-census/less-than-five.html[built theirs], they took things to the next level by developing tools and techniques to build those maps quickly, which they then http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/2011/03/08/making-maps-1/[made available] for other organizations to use.

At my employer, the Center for Investigative Reporting, we coupled a simple searchable database with a fine-grained event tracking framework that allowed us to learn, among other things, how much users value serendipity and exploration in our news apps.

At the risk of sounding like a bean-counter, always think about http://cironline.org/blog/post/beyond-three-ps-few-more-thoughts-business-news-apps[return on investment]. Solve a generic problem; create a new way to engage users; open source parts of your work; use analytics to learn more about your users; or even find cases like Curbwise where part of your app might generate revenue.

**Wrapping up**

News application development has come a long way in a very short time. News Apps 1.0 were a lot like Infographics 2.0 – interactive data visualizations, mixed with searchable databases, designed primarily to advance the narrative of the story. Now, many of those apps can be designed by reporters on deadline using open source tools, freeing up developers to think bigger thoughts.

News Apps 2.0, where the industry is headed, is about combining the storytelling and public service strengths of journalism with the product development discipline and expertise of the technology world. The result, no doubt, will be an explosion of innovation around ways to make data relevant, interesting and especially useful to our audience – and at the same time hopefully helping journalism do the same.

=== News Apps at Propublica (Scott Klein, ProPublica) ===

A news application is a broad, deep interactive database that tells a news story. By exposing specific data to them, a news app can tell each reader's story. It can help a reader understand their personal stake in a broad national phenomenon, and help them attach what they know to what they don't know to encourage a deep understanding of abstract concepts.

We tend to build news apps when we have a dataset (or think we can acquire a dataset) that is both national and granular enough to expose details.

Just like any good story, a news app has a headline, a byline, a lead, and a nut. Some of these concepts can be hard to distinguish in a piece of interactive software, but they're there.

Also, a news app should be generative - meaning it should generate more reporting. ProPublica's best apps have been used as sources in hundreds of local stories.

image::Figures/06-FF.png[width=600]

One of the very best news apps we've seen is the Los Angeles Times's http://projects.latimes.com/mapping-la/neighborhoods/[Mapping L.A.], which started out as a crowdsourced map of Los Angeles's many neighborhoods, which have no good, independent, widely-accepted set of boundaries. After that initial project, the Times has been able to report out things like crime rate by neighborhood, school quality by neighborhood, and many other things which they wouldn't have been able to do before. So not only is this app both broad and specific, it's generative, it tells people's own stories, etc.

The resources necessary to build a news app ranges pretty widely. The New York Times has dozens of people working on news apps and on very complex graphics. But Talking Points Memo made a cutting edge poll tracker app with two staffers, neither of whom had computer science degrees.

Like most newsroom-based coders, we follow a modified Agile methodology to build our apps. We iterate quickly and show drafts to the other folks in the newsoom we're working with. Most importantly we work really closely with reporters and read drafts - even early ones. 

Why should newsrooms be interested in producing data-driven news apps? It's great journalism, it's hugely popular -- ProPublica's most popular features are news apps, and if we don't do it somebody else will -- and think of all the scoops we'd miss! Most importantly, newsrooms should know that they can do this too. It's easier than it looks.

=== Data Visualisation in Journalism: An Introduction (Sarah Cohen, Washington Post) ===

Waiting for text.

=== Using Visualisations to Tell Stories (Geoff McGhee, Stanford University) ===

Waiting for text.

=== How Data Visualisation is Used at the Most Read Daily Newspaper in Norway (John Bones, Verdens Gang) ===

News journalism is about bringing new information to the reader as quickly as possible. The fastest way may be a video, a photo, a text, a graph, a table or a combination of these. Concerning visualisations, the purpose should be the same: quick information. New data tools enable journalists to find stories they couldn't otherwise find, and present stories in new ways. Here are a few examples showing how data visualisation is used in the most read newspaper in Norway, Verdens Gang (VG).

*1. When the Visualisation is the Story*

_Here is Crime Happening - Hour by Hour_

image::Figures/06-BB.png[width=600]

In [this animated heatmap combined with a simple bar chart](http://www.vgtv.no/#!id=46131) you can watch see crime incidents occur on a map of downtown Oslo, hour by hour, over the weekend for several months. In the same animated heatmap, you can see the number of police officers working at the same time. When crime really is happening, the number of police officers is at the bottom.

Tools used: ArcView with Spatial Analyst.

*2. When the Visualisation Helps us Find the story*
 
_The Network of Movie Stars_

In this Social Network Analysis, VG downloaded all relations in all Norwegian movies during more than ten years. Who acts with whom, and which actors work with different directors? A database with all relevant content was exported to UCINET, a program for social network analysis. It was then quite easy to see who was connected with whom, with different strength of ties.

_Rich children are playing together_

The same methods were used when downloading 157 lists of friends from Facebook. These 157 people were sons and daughters of the richest people in Norway, and the social network analysis showed that heirs of the richest persons in Norway also inherited their parents' network. The graphics were all finished manually using Photoshop.

Tools used: Access, Excel Notepad, Ucinet.

Lessons: When making social network analysis, we get an enormous amount of data. When making the presentation, we had to do a lot of manual work at the end.

Anecdotes: The most central person in the movie network denied there was a network!

**3. When the Visualisation is Telling the Story**
 
_Out of the Ghetto_

One story looked at internal migration in Oslo, based on data from The Norwegian Bureau of Statistics. The angle for the story is the development among the biggest immigration groups in Oslo, and the reader does not have to read the text to understand the news.

Tools used: Excel, Access, ArcView.

Lessons learned: Too much text on the pages. It would have been better to concentrate 100 percent on the graphs.

**4. When the Visualisation is Supplying the Text**
 
_Erna is the Queen of Applause_

For http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/valg-2009/artikkel.php?artid=570321[this visualization] we text mined speeches held by the seven Norwegian party leaders during their conventions. All speeches were analysed, and the analyses supplied angles for some stories. Every story was linked to the graph, and the readers could explore and study the language of politicians.

Tools used: Excel, Access, Flash and Illustrator.

Lessons: In 2012 we would have made the interactive graph in Javascript.

We do not yet have good tools for text mining.

**5. When the Visualisation is an Integrated Part**
 
Mekka of the slots in the north (of Norway)

This story is about the use of slots in the different parts of Norway. The text, the tables, the graph and the photo are all parts of an integrated solution.

Tools used: Most important was Access database. The mapping solution is made in ArcView.

**6. When the Graphs are Interactive:**
 
_Here People are Using Most of their Income on Lotto_

http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=569832[This story] is based on data from the Norwegian Bureau of Statistics, taxpayers data and data from the national Lotto monopolist. In this interactive graph, the reader could find different kinds of information from each Norwegian county and municipality. The actual table is showing the percent of the income used on games.

Tools used: Access, Excel, MySql, Flash
 
Translation of the column titles: Pristilskudd = price given by the dairy.
Produksjonstilskudd = national subsidies
Link: http://www.vg.no/spesial/jordbrukstilskudd/

The data in this table is containing farm subsidies to all Norwegian farmers, some 46 000. By clicking at the drop down menu at the top of the graph, the readers could choose county and municipality.
Tools used: Access, Excel, MySql.
Lessons learned: This table and the stories connected to it was the most read that day. The graphs do not necessarily need to be fancy to capture readers.

**7. When the Visualisation is User-generated:**
 
_Here People Are Most Afraid in Oslo_

http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=10091789[This Google heat map] is based upon information given by 16 000 readers. There had been several rapes downtown Oslo, and the readers could click at a Google map to show were in Oslo they did not feel safe.

Tools used: Google Fusion Tables with heatmap, Google maps, MySql. 

*Concluding Notes*

When do we need to visualise a story? Most of the times we do not need to do it, but sometimes we want to do so to help our readers. Stories containing a huge amount of data quite often need visualisation. However, we have to be quite critical when choosing what kind of data we are going to present. We know all kinds of stuff when we report about something, but does the reader really need to know for the story? Perhaps a table is enough, or a simple graph showing a development from year A to year C. When working with data journalism, the point is not necessarily to present huge amounts of data. It's about journalism!

There has been a clear trend in last 2-3 years to create interactive graphs and tables which enable the reader to drill down into different themes. A good visualisation is like a good picture. You understand what it is about just by looking at it for a moment or two. The more you look at the visual the more you see. The visualisation is bad when the reader does not know where to start or where to stop, and when the visualisation is overloaded by details. In this scenario, perhaps a piece of text would be better?

=== Data Driven Apps at Internews in Kenya (Mark Irungu, Internews Network) ===

On the 6th of July 2011, the Kenyan government became the first in Africa to have a national open data portal. Making government data open is not a very popular idea that regimes would readily embrace in Africa, not with the rampant corruption and mismanagement of public funds. Understandably, the Kenyan Government has received a lot of accolades for that.

While this World Bank supported initiative received a lot of praise globally (from the New York Times to government heads in the developed world) the scenario was different locally. It was great news in the techie world but just another tiny story in the world of journalism. The story was not covered beyond the day of the launch. Few journalists visited portal after the launch. The data is accessible online and just like all data sets; it is not in the smallest way friendly to the eye, at least not a journalist's eye.

*The GAP*

The techies have taken the idea and run with it, trying to think of applications that could be developed to mine the data, clean the data and visualise it making it more accessible to people beyond the developer community.

A new digital divide exists, not just in Kenya, between journalists and developers in working with data. Journalists need to learn more about the mechanics of using data. Developers, also called techies, also have a lot to learn. Developers may be brilliant with code, but have a lot to learn with regard to content, the opposite is true for journalists. Why not leverage these strengths to form a `tag team'? They do not necessarily have to be at the same place at the same time, all we need is an interface co connect them. What the data world needs is a good app that can serve these groups.

*The APP*

The power of data cannot be under estimated. It is time that newsrooms and journalists moved away from the ``he said, she said'' reporting. Numbers can help journalists produce in-depth features, and explore untold stories and trends that are not immediately known or visible to the general public. Unfortunately, journalists in Kenya have not made good use of the opened data. I work at Internews in Kenya - a media development organisation that trains and supports journalists to be better storytellers. In our journalism workshops we have designed a number of courses to help journalists use numbers and data better for their storytelling. This is important as it helps journalists to enrich their enquiry and stories.

It is with this realisation that the idea of developing an app to query KODI was born. There is need for a a solution that would help journalists clean up raw data in the back end and help journalist to identify emerging stories and trends.That app should also help in presenting the content in visually appealing ways. 

The app should:

1. Query the entire Kenya open data portal.
2. Clean the data / provide a friendly interface for cleaning the data.
3. Visualise the data.
4. Generate reports that can be used as is.

*The Target*

We are facing a unique scenario. Who were we targeting? We have had to determine whether this is going to be a case of old hands, new tricks or new hands, new tricks. Traditional journalism has undergone a radical evolution process with the development of the web. Maybe that was enough. Yes there is a significant gap between journalists and techies, but we have also established that the desire to among journalists to learn and possibly close this gap is very strong . The `evolved' traditional journalist has been showing willingness to undergo a second metamorphosis and the upcoming journalist doesn't mind this baptism of fire. The app we are working will serve journalists at all levels.

*The Team and the Technology*

Over the past 8 years, Internews has worked in Kenya with journalists to build capacity in health and conflict sensitive reporting through training, mentoring, travel grants and availing resources for journalists at the Nairobi and Eldoret offices. The idea of developing an app has come hand in hand with the idea of setting up a Center for Digital journalism at the Kenya office. This centre does more or less what Internews has been doing but at a digital scale. The centre also `incubates' upcoming and evolving data/digital journalists and has facilities that aid such journalists in production of complex and compelling stories.

To develop this app, we have had to face the fact that we do not know everything and we needed to talk to those who may have taken our path before leveraging on our relationship with various developer communities in Nairobi to form a team that would work towards our end product. Our first choice approach was the use of PHP ZEND framework and ADOBE flex and flash builder 4.5 for php. We initially felt these platforms would be sufficient to start us off. However, along the way we have picked up on other technologies that we believe will spice up the end result e.g. the Data Journalism Developer Studio running on open Linux. The tool will run across all platforms; web, desktop, mobile. With the high uptake and use of mobile phones in Kenya, it is Important that all Open data tools should be able to run on mobile platforms (J2ME, Android).

Developers vary in coding strengths and language preferences. After determining which languages our platform would run on, we have had to identify strong team members that would deliver the quality of code that would make this world-class product. We have also distinguished those working on the front end (user experience) and those working on the back end (dirty work). The two teams have to sync at the application level and there is need for a strong working relationship.

Kenya has clearly made some bold steps but there is still a lot of ground to cover. The biggest challenge is not coming up with the idea but in having a worthy team. An outcome based approach team that endears its energies to the overall objective makes product successful. If used well, data can be life changing. Electoral dynamics especially in voting patterns in Kenya have been devoid of content and objectivity. With available data, this and many other systems in Kenya can change for the better. 

**2. How to build a news app**

A news app is a software (web, desktop, mobile, USSD) that acts as an interface between the database layer of the information architecture and the client side. News apps make data friendlier to the client as compared to the format and layout at the storage engine. 

News Apps vary in type:

1. Curation- This is an app that gathers already existing information and brings it to one platform based on a particular keyword(s). This kind of app may not necessarily have its own storage engine, some depend on a 'Google type' indexing mechanism that crawls the net and indexes searchable information. Examples of Curation APPS; Storify, Storyful.

2. News Portals- these are online news portals that deliver news in real time. News websites, news applications running on mobile platforms, aggregated feed readers fall in this category.

3. Citizen reporting- these are apps whose main source of data is the citizen. These apps provide an interface for citizen-journalism and then visualise the data graphically or on a map. E.g.: Ushahidi, crowdmap, swiftriver.

4. Data apps - These are apps that query DATA sets from governments, organisations, civil society etc. These Apps may have their own storage engine that is updated regularly from the main data source e.g. World Bank finances, Kenya open data. Examples of such applications: CDF monitor (Kenya) Internews Open DATA app (Kenya).

*Why and for who?*

News Apps are not for journalists only. Most news apps are coded to produce interactive and friendly reports that can be used by any news savvy person. The act of interacting with a news app looking for news is in itself journalism. Newsrooms, News organisations, governments, and civil society should commission development of news apps based on need.

In the age of open source tools, re-inventing the wheel is not necessary. When making the decision to develop a news app, it is imperative to survey the current news landscape and identify tools that do at least half of what you'd like to see. Chances are that in most instances you may just combine two different tools with great precision. For example, when working on large data sets you may be looking for a tool that will clean the data and also visualise it in clean interactive graphs, charts, bubbles and possibly maps. You may want, in this instance, to clean the data on Google Refine, and then export the data to Tile Mill to visualise it on a map and to infogr.am to plot it on a matrix! 

However, there are rare scenarios like that of Kenya where relationships between datasets need to be established on the fly in order to generate some visualisations that may require you to develop an app altogether. This saves the non-techie journalist the hassle, for example, of trying to join a table with all constituencies in Kenya with another with their latitude and longitude co-ordinates in order to plot the info on a map.

The main idea of developing a news app should be motivated by the need to make data friendlier. If your news app does not make your numbers easier to understand then it is not worth the time and money.

A good news app should:

1. Mine the data- extracting data sets from the source.
2. Clean the data- pick out anomalies in the data and highlight them to the user. The user then corrects the anomalies.
3. Export data- have export data functionality.
4. Visualise the data

Open source apps have indeed made things easier for all of us; the ability to even alter the source code of a free product release under the GPL license is particularly enticing. It is however important to apply news apps to the context for which they were developed and not to the context that cuts costs for you as a news organisation. 

A classical example is the Ushahidi platform; Ushahidi was built mainly for crisis citizen reporting. It worked perfect during the post election violence in Kenya and mapping of hotspots, and even better during the Haiti earthquake and the BP oil spill. But it stops working when used for activities that do not engage citizens to report e.g. mapping out country offices of an organisation. 

*Packaging*
 
The success or failure of an app is strongly dependent on how it is packaged. Packaging in this case refers mainly to the platforms for which it is built. Developers should aim at presenting very flexible and useable apps. Limiting an app to one operating system e.g. Windows is a big setback and significantly contributes to the failure of the app.

To counter such issues, developers are encouraged to come up with fully functional online versions of applications before thinking of the desktop app. An online app only locks out someone without a browser! Desktop versions and mobile versions should be added features and not the other way round.

*Resources*

Having powerful computers, big screens, servers and test platforms is a good thing when developing a news app, having good human resources is even better. The skill set required in this case is unique: a combination of UX, backend and security is required. Developers should take advantage and participate in online communities, developer meet ups, hackathons, workshops and boot camps to sharpen their skills. Technology, just like traditional journalism, is constantly evolving and every developer should work with this realisation. Laxity is not an option.

=== Public Data Goes Social (Oluseun Onigbinde, BudgIT Nigeria) ===

Data is invaluable. Access to data has the potential to illuminate issues in a way which triggers results. Nevertheless, poor handling of data can put facts in an opaque structure which communicates nothing. If it doesn't promote discussion or provide contextual understanding, data may be of limited value to the public.

Nigeria returned to democracy in 1999 after lengthy years of military rule. Probing the facts behind data was taken as an affront to authority and was seen to be trying question the stained reputation of the junta. The Official Secrets Act compelled civil servants not to share government information. Even after thirteen years of return to democracy, accessing public data can be a difficult task. Data about public expenditure communicates little to the majority of the public who are not well versed in financial accounting and complex arithmetic. 

With the rise of mobile devices and an increasing number of Nigerians online, with BudgIT we saw a huge opportunity to use use data visualisation technologies to explain and engage people around public expenditure. To do this we have had to engage users across all platforms and to reach out to citizens via NGOs. This project is about making public data a social object and building an extensive network that demands change.

image::Figures/06-YY.png[width=600]

To successfully engage with users, we have to understand what they want. What does the Nigerian citizen care about? Where do they feel an information gap? How can we make the data relevant to their lives? BudgIT's immediate target is the average literate Nigerian connected to online forums and social media. In order to compete for the limited attention of users immersed in a wide variety of interests (gaming, reading, socialising) we need to present the data in a brief and concise manner. After broadcasting a snapshot of the data as a Tweet or an infographic, there's an opportunity for a more sustained engagement with a more interactive experience to give users a bigger picture.

When visualising data it is important to understand the level of data literacy of our users. As beautiful and sophisticated as they may be, complex diagrams and interactive applications might not meaningfully communicate to our users based on their previous experiences with interpreting data. A good visualisation will speak to the user in a language they can understand, and bring forth a story that they can easily connect with.

We have engaged over 10,000 Nigerians over the budget and we profile them into three categories to ensure that optimum value is delivered. The categories are briefly explained below:

  * _Occasional Users_. These are users who want information simply and quickly. They are interested in getting a picture of the data, not detailed analytics. We can engage them via Tweets or interactive graphics.
  * _Active Users_. Users who stimulate discussion, and use the data to increase their knowledge of a given area or challenge the assumptions of the data. For these users we want to provide feedback mechanisms and the possibility to share insights with their peers via social networks.
  * _Data Hogs_: These users want raw data for visualisation or analysis. We simply give them the data for their purposes.

With BudgIT, our user engagement is based on the following: 

  * _Stimulating Discussion Around Current Trends_. BudgIT keeps track of online and offline discussions and seeks to provide data around these topics. For example, with the fuel strikes in January 2012 there was constant agitation among the protesters on the need to reinstate fuel subsidies and reduce extravagant and unnecessary public expenditure. BudgIT tracked the discussion via social media and in 36 busy hours built an app that allows citizens to reorganise the Nigerian budget.
  * _Good Feedback Mechanisms_. We engage with users through discussion channels and social media. Many users want to know about stories behind the data and many ask for our opinion. We make sure that our responses only explain the facts behind the data and our not biased by our personal or political views. We need to keep feedback channels open, to actively respond to comments and to engage the users creatively to ensure the community built around the data is sustained.
  * _Make it Local_. For a dataset targeted at a particular group, BudgIT aims to localise its content and to promote a channel of discussion that connects to the needs and interests of particular groups of users. In particular we're interested in engaging users around issues they care about via SMS.

After making expenditure data available on yourbudgit.com, we reach out to citizens through various NGOs. We also plan to develop a participatory framework where citizens and government institutions can meet in town halls to define key items in the budget that needs to be prioritised. 

=== Engaging Your Audience (Duncan Geere, Wired.co.uk) ===

Almost as important as publishing the data in the first place is getting a reaction from your audience. You're human - you're going to make mistakes, miss things and get the wrong idea from time to time. Your audience is one of the most useful assets that you've got - they can fact-check and point out things that you may not have considered.

Engaging that audience is tricky, though. You're dealing with a group of people who've been conditioned over years of internet use to hop from site to site, leaving nothing but a sarcastic comment in their wake. Building a level of trust between you and your users is crucial - they need to know what they're going to get, know how they can react to it and offer feedback, and know that that feedback is going to be listened to.

But first you need to think about what audience you've got, or want to get. That will both inform and be informed by the kind of data that you're working with. If it's specific to a particular sector, then you're going to want to explore particular communications with that sector. Are there trade bodies that you can get in touch with that might be willing to publicise the resources that you've got and the work that you've done to a wider audience? Is there a community website or a forum that you can get in touch with?

Social media is an important tool, too, though it again depends on the type of data that you're working with. If you're looking at global shipping statistics, for example, you're unlikely to find a group on Facebook or Twitter that'll be especially interested in your work. On the other hand if you're sifting through corruption indices across the world, or local crime statistics, that's likely to be something that's going to be of interest to a rather wider audience.

Then you need to think about how those people are going to interact with your work. Sure, they might read the story that you've written and look at the infographics or maps, but giving your users an outlet to respond is immensely valuable. More than anything it's likely to give you greater insight into the subject you're writing about, informing future work on the topic.

It goes without saying that you need to publish the raw data alongside your articles, but think about if there's other ways that you can get the audience to interact. Keep an eye on metrics on which parts of your datasets are getting attention - it's likely that the most trafficked areas could have something to say that you might have missed.

Think beyond the comment box, too. Can you attach comments to particular cells in a spreadsheet? Or a particular region of an infographic? Make sure that other users can see those comments too - they have almost as much value as the original data, in a lot of cases.

Finally, other people might want to publish their own infographics and stories on the same sources of data - think about how best to tie that information together. You could use a hashtag specific to the dataset, for example, or if it's highly pictorial then you could share it in a Flickr group. Having a route to share information more confidentially could be useful too -- in some cases it might not be safe for people to publicly share their contributions to a dataset, or they might simply not be comfortable doing so.
