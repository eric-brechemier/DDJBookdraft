To incorporate into short intro:

A http://datadrivenjournalism.net/news_and_analysis/data_journalism_survey_analysis[survey] on training needs for data journalism circulated by the European Journalism Centre between April and August 2011 showed that 39% of the 234 respondents envisioned their organisation to start engaging in data journalism through engaging a combination of external experts and existing staff. 36% envisioned training existing staff.

In the following chapter journalists involved in data journalism projects explain models for doing data journalism in their newsroom.

In-house expertise

### Projects realized with external experts

Some datasets or methods require special skills i.e. programming skills to manage the data and visualize it. Don't stop your passion for your idea because of missing these skills in your newsroom. There are a lot of highly motivated developers and designers out there to come into your project.

### Measuring impact ###

Overview: Give overview of the potential of data journalism (e.g. engaging with new audiences, the future of journalism on the web) and how it could be measured.
Authors: Mirko Lorenz (Deutsche Welle), Lorenz Matzat (Open Data City)
Length: 1 page
Editor: Liliana Bounegru

Measuring the success of a data story is in no way different than the generally used indicators: page views, how long people stay on a page, etc.

Data journalists report though that people appear to engage longer with data stories than with other types of posts.

The Texas Tribune databases drive majority of site's traffic, according to a Poynter article.



=== Using Data Journalism to Build Reputation and Trust (Sascha Venohr, Zeit Online) ===

Data journalism projects can bring newsrooms into the exciting position to bring a Wow-Effect to the audience and give a new way of bringing stories and facts on their side. For example, there was a wide coverage about the situation at the nuclear plant in japanese Fukushima after the Tsunami. After radioactive material escaped from the power plant, everyone within 30 kilometres of the plant was evacuated. People could read and see a lot about the evacuations. ZEIT ONLINE found a innovative way to explain it's German audience the impact using data journalism. We asked: How many people live near a nuclear power plant in Germany? How many people lives within a radius of 30 kilometres? A map showes http://opendata.zeit.de/atomreaktoren/#/en/[how many people would have to be evacuated in a similar situation in Germany]. The result: A big traffic success and one of these Wow-Effects waving over the social media sphere. In addition, projects based on structured data can easily adopted to other perspectives and languages. So we did. We transponded the Map to http://opendata.zeit.de/nuclear-reactors-usa/#/en/[nuclear power plants in the US] in an english version. A great traffic-motor again.

Another point is, that news labels want to be respected as a trusted source. Using data journalism projects combined with enabling the readers to look and reuse the raw data brings a high value of credibility to these newsrooms. As the Guardian says: facts are sacred.

So you have the data... what next? Where do you start and where could you end?

In this section, top data-journalists take us through useful tips and tricks for how they have produced their data-powered stories before diving deeper into what made them determined to work on a particular project, why they chose the methods they did, the barriers they encountered, lessons learned and the eventual impact the stories made....

More case studies

http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/may/15/mps-expenses-heather-brooke-foi[MPs expenses scandal] in the UK is an example of how a simple Freedom of Information (FOI) request can trigger a large scale investigation. An FOI request uncovered some interesting stories about how elected officials spend taxpayers' money.

case study 1

You've poured hours into tidying up and working with your data and got your story. What do you do with the data now? In this chapter, we take a look at cases where journalists have decided to open up their datasets and publish them along with their stories: What role did the datasets play in the original story? What was the motivation for opening them up? What did others choose to do with the data?

Introduction

by Lucy Chambers
In this chapter, we aim to show you how to get your hands on the best data available to further your investigation. Sometimes you don't have to look far, the data may already be out there: it is a matter of knowing where to look. Other times, you may need to find the right people to ask. In particular, this chapter deals with:
  *  	Tips and tricks for where to look for data: before launching into FOI requests or embarking down a technical route such as scraping.
  *  	Search tips: How to make Google give you want you want, in the format you want it.
  *    Communities for data: useful forums and mailing lists to ask experts directly
  *  	Data houses: data catalogues, government portals, accessing research data and social data sites
Finally, we'll have a quick look at the legal implications of re-using data from web databases - while you may decide to break copyright to get your story out, it is still useful to know the boundaries in current law.
