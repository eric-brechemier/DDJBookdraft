To incorporate into short intro:

A http://datadrivenjournalism.net/news_and_analysis/data_journalism_survey_analysis[survey] on training needs for data journalism circulated by the European Journalism Centre between April and August 2011 showed that 39% of the 234 respondents envisioned their organisation to start engaging in data journalism through engaging a combination of external experts and existing staff. 36% envisioned training existing staff.

In the following chapter journalists involved in data journalism projects explain models for doing data journalism in their newsroom.

In-house expertise

### Projects realized with external experts

Some datasets or methods require special skills i.e. programming skills to manage the data and visualize it. Don't stop your passion for your idea because of missing these skills in your newsroom. There are a lot of highly motivated developers and designers out there to come into your project.

### Measuring impact ###

Overview: Give overview of the potential of data journalism (e.g. engaging with new audiences, the future of journalism on the web) and how it could be measured.
Authors: Mirko Lorenz (Deutsche Welle), Lorenz Matzat (Open Data City)
Length: 1 page
Editor: Liliana Bounegru

Measuring the success of a data story is in no way different than the generally used indicators: page views, how long people stay on a page, etc.

Data journalists report though that people appear to engage longer with data stories than with other types of posts.

The Texas Tribune databases drive majority of site's traffic, according to a Poynter article.



=== Using Data Journalism to Build Reputation and Trust (Sascha Venohr, Zeit Online) ===

Data journalism projects can bring newsrooms into the exciting position to bring a Wow-Effect to the audience and give a new way of bringing stories and facts on their side. For example, there was a wide coverage about the situation at the nuclear plant in japanese Fukushima after the Tsunami. After radioactive material escaped from the power plant, everyone within 30 kilometres of the plant was evacuated. People could read and see a lot about the evacuations. ZEIT ONLINE found a innovative way to explain it's German audience the impact using data journalism. We asked: How many people live near a nuclear power plant in Germany? How many people lives within a radius of 30 kilometres? A map showes http://opendata.zeit.de/atomreaktoren/#/en/[how many people would have to be evacuated in a similar situation in Germany]. The result: A big traffic success and one of these Wow-Effects waving over the social media sphere. In addition, projects based on structured data can easily adopted to other perspectives and languages. So we did. We transponded the Map to http://opendata.zeit.de/nuclear-reactors-usa/#/en/[nuclear power plants in the US] in an english version. A great traffic-motor again.

Another point is, that news labels want to be respected as a trusted source. Using data journalism projects combined with enabling the readers to look and reuse the raw data brings a high value of credibility to these newsrooms. As the Guardian says: facts are sacred.

Introduction

by Lucy Chambers
In this chapter, we aim to show you how to get your hands on the best data available to further your investigation. Sometimes you don't have to look far, the data may already be out there: it is a matter of knowing where to look. Other times, you may need to find the right people to ask. In particular, this chapter deals with:
  *  	Tips and tricks for where to look for data: before launching into FOI requests or embarking down a technical route such as scraping.
  *  	Search tips: How to make Google give you want you want, in the format you want it.
  *    Communities for data: useful forums and mailing lists to ask experts directly
  *  	Data houses: data catalogues, government portals, accessing research data and social data sites
Finally, we'll have a quick look at the legal implications of re-using data from web databases - while you may decide to break copyright to get your story out, it is still useful to know the boundaries in current law.

### Reference data ###

by Friedrich Lindenberg

It's often helpful to pull in data from code sheets, such as lists of countries, states, organizations etc. This kind of data - which is used to augment another collection - is called reference data. Other examples of reference data include code sheets to decipher classifications and taxonomies, such as the EU's procurement vocabulary: on most portals, only short identifiers are provided, while the actual term descriptions are quite helpful.

Some sources for reference data include:
  *    http://www.geonames.org/[GeoNames] and http://open.mapquestapi.com/nominatim/[Nominatim] for geographic names and coordinates.
  *    National statistics agencies
  *    Web sites of standards bodies, such as the ISO (e.g. country codes) or the http://iatistandard.org/[IATI Standard] site.
  *    International organisations such as the United Nations (e.g. classification of functions of government).



-------

Information held by public bodies is one of the principle sources of data for the work of any journalist. The right of access to information (aka "freedom of information") is the right of anyone to access information held by public authorities. Many countries now have freedom of information laws to make this information available to the public. This chapter deals with:
FOIA for data - what to ask for, what format to request it in and how to ask for it
Case studies about stories based on successful data FOI requests.



For more detailed information on the process of submitting an FOI request, the difference in FOI legislation in different countries and appeal procedures see the FOI tipsheet.


-------

Privacy Concerns and FOI for databases


Privacy concerns: For data journalists trying to get access to a full data set, issue might come up because some of the information in the data set is confidential and the public authority uses this as a reason for not providing the entire database. This is not acceptable under the right of access to information: public bodies have to provide at least partial access.

For example, by removing personal data fields from the database so that the data journalist can see all the statistical and factual data the public authority would not be violating confidentiality. All exceptions must be justified by the public body and you have a right to appeal.
TIP: "Look at the 'disclosure logs' that some public authorities have on their websites, which list some or all of their responses to previous FOI requests. They are a good source of ideas about what kind of information you are actually likely to obtain." (Martin Rosenbaum - BBC)

Crowdsourcing can be helpful both for collecting data - e.g. using forms, polls, social media, or dedicated apps - and cleaning up, exploring or making sense of big datasets you already have but that are too big for you to look through by yourself. It can also be a good way to get different perspectives on a subject as readers can point out details that you might not have noticed.

How to collect data from content already published in social media 

using Twitter hashtags (examples: emergency hashtags used in the event of an earthquake or huricane in the US)
using Tools such as:

People Browser
Social mention (media monitoring tools)
Disqus

Keyword search, what is discussed about specific topics on the web? 
Look for the right keywords. Certain topics have different words in different countries (football, soccer, etc.). 
Make your search as specified or as wide as possible, as adapted as possible to your search. 
consider language, country, target groups 
gather information from different platforms to get a common opinion
cross check to make sure the information is reliable and consistent

  * Preparing Data
  * Reconciliation
  * Combining Datasets (cf: http://www.opendatacookbook.net/wiki/recipe/a_dataset_mixture_with_yahoo_pipes)
  * Text Mining

Working with data implies identifying, collecting, cleaning, analyzing, using and sharing the data you are using for your story. When working with data, you will find this iterative and potentially messy. Sometimes you will know exactly what you are looking for, and sometimes you will go fishing. Occasionally a story will emerge from the data. Often, you will be able to complement a story with more hard evidence or helpful information so readers can understand better.

* Be aware of the provenance and terms of use of your data
* Understand the limitations of your data (Is it reliable? Is it accurate?)
* Be transparent about how you used the data so others can use it.

**5. Analyzing your data**

After collecting data (Chapter 2) it is important to understand your dataset.
What type of analysis do you need to do? What are you comparing?
Time-based
Geographic regions
Cross-sectional: what are the portions of the whole (e.g., by race for census data)

Depending on what kind of data analysis you are doing, there are a range of different types of tools you can use. For this see chapter 3.3 Tools for Analysing data.	

Detecting dodgy data

Not all data comes from measurement of real-life numbers. From individuals to organisations, the pressure to support an argument with stats can unfortunately lead people to fabricate, falsify and omit data.

Even those who understand the importance of good data aren't beyond reproach: for example, http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005738[2% of scientists have admitted to tampering with data]. This is a conservative estimate based on surveys, so the true number of researchers who have committed fraud through data manipulation may be much higher.

So how do you identify dodgy data? Although it's impossible to spot fraud simply by looking at numbers directly, luckily there are a few statistical tests that can help you detect anomalies. One of the most practical is a strange statistical phenomenon known as Benford's law, or the leading-digit law.

According to Benford's law, in a list of numbers from natural sources of data, the leading digit (e.g. the 1 in 10) is not distributed randomly. While you might expect the digits 0 to 9 to each be found in 11 per cent of cases, the digit 1 actually appears about 30% of the time. The other digits appear in lower and lower frequencies, following an exponential decline, ending with numbers that have a leading 9 only occurring in under 5% of numbers from the list.

////

Insert: Creative Commons image of Benford curve here?

////


This phenomenon appears in many lists of data from natural sources, which means that deviations from Benford's law may indicate false data. If you plot each leading digit in a data set against the frequency with which they appear, you should get a graph showing an exponential decline, which is what you would expect from Benford's law.

To test whether your data is dodgy, all you have to do it take the leading digit from a list of numbers in your data, tally the number of times each digit appears, and then superimpose this over a Benford curve. If your data matches the expected curve, then your data is probably free of fabrication.

Roles of visualisation in journalism by Lulu Pinney

The function of data visualisations in reportage is twofold. Firstly they are a tool for exploring the data to find where any stories are. Their second use is for telling a story. And it is worth noting that - for the same set of data - it is more than likely that the visuals best suited to finding a story will not be best suited to the telling of it.

Using visualisations to explore data is a more objective exercise, and sometimes it is appropriate to create an interface so your audience can have a go themselves. Alternatively having explored and interpreted the data yourself, you can choose just to present the stories you have found in a more subjective - or editorial - manner to your audience, with or without supporting visualisations.

more on this from Sarah Cohen at the end of Feb.; more specifically Mainly on the use of it inside the newsroom to hone the story -- expanding on that handout you found. The real weakness there is that there are not good, free tools to use when you're not willing to make your data public.

=== Citizen Engagement with Data Journalism (César Viana, Estacio de Sa University) ===

////

Insert: picture from projects

////

Journalism demands engagement with the public. This is a feature since the first newspapers that also influenced the creation of nation-states in the 17th century. At that time readers identified themselves with each other because at least they shared similar culture, imaginary, language and community interests. Whether this interaction is now through text, audio, audiovisual, animation or any other new visualization processes, trust and transparency are still crucial among journalists and citizen stakeholders.
Much before having any kind of communication technology our civilization were founded on storytelling and connection among people. A story is relevant as far as the audiences feel represented on it. But it took us centuries to improve the ways to bring people, and nations, closer to each other in a global - and almost apt to be scrutinized - scene. But the challenge still resides on experimenting emerging principles and practice of citizen engagement on inclusive journalistic perspectives to foster information access and popular participation.
Preparing and implementing editorial products based on datasets include as well participating on social conversations and considering user-centred design of information to better achieve citizen involvement. There are innovative ways to monitor feedbacks and civic participation on the social web and to encourage the creation of environments for dialog and social innovation.
A news professional might be prepared to attend the demands of the public and influence their capacity to act alongside their peers. The more people take ownership of these communication resources; greater are the reflections of the journalistic efforts in the everyday of society and vice versa.
Despite of being able to create data-driven journalism applications and services that are representative and able for accomplishing social improvements, the role of journalists is also enhance the social inclusion and education. A decisive way to do this is collaborate with the approach between the civic society stakeholders and the practitioners or researchers of ICT's into human-centred outlooks.
The multidisciplinarity common to the variety of editorial sections of journalism has always collaborated with the interrelationship among different domains. When drawing or implementing strategies and plans consider leveraging opportunities and providing the knowledge and the skills to warrant inclusiveness, diversity and innovation in our societies. Make sure your project contributes to empower people through technology and/or media literacy.
If only by consuming or sharing news, the public is involved in modeling of information systems. Therefore, it is necessary to provide the best resources for collaboration and joint construction of stories. There is a growing emergence of examples that stand out in this foray:

http://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/introducing-docdiver[DocDiver] is an application to stimulate readers on working beside ProPublica investigative reporters' team to identify and share key bits of information in documents.

http://www.documentcloud.org/home[DocumentCloud] is preparing a new feature to engage readers in discussing and crowdsourcing news by allowing them to add their own notes and comments to material collected and displayed.

http://www.ft.com/intl/eu-funds[EUfunds] is collaboration between the Financial Times and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism to help readers on tracking European Union structural funds.

https://www.drumbeat.org/en-US/journalism/about/[MoJo] is the Knight-Mozilla partnership to bring together technologists and journalists in developing innovative solutions.

http://www.a24media.com/whatsyourstory/[Africa: What's Your Story] is a collaborative platform of the citizen news agency A24Media to implicate people from across the continent on sharing information about media freedom, corruption, health, education and other issues in video, text and audio.

The collaborative ways of treating or recirculating information and the bias for popular mobilizations are already means for important changes in this recent world of new media, big data sources and participatory culture. Even if only around 30 percent of the world population was online by the end 2010 (source: http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/publications/idi/2011/index.html[2011 ITU report]), there are space for commitment to spread the principles of freedom and to share experiences, best practice and opportunities to improve the capability of citizens and other stakeholders to write/interact/play/sense the next chapters of the history of press.

There are many tools that simplify the creation of maps from digital data. 
http://code.google.com/apis/maps/index.html

This classic map shows the advance and retreat of Napolean's army in Russia using width to indicate army size, color to represent direction and a sharp aesthetic to show the severity of the event. http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/posters



Graphs
There are many ways to use graphs to visualize data. Data sets that focus on pairs of information such as quantity x over time or age over height are often prime. A third piece of data can usually be shown through size or color of data points. For trending information and regular distributions, such as population over time lines can connect points. Multiple sets of relevant information can also be plotted so long as they are distinguished. This can be helpful in showing upper and lower bounds or the way in which two related quantities move together over time.

It is important to keep your target audience in mind when using graphs, more so even than most other forms of visualization. Graphs are technical things. If they aren't clear or contain extraneous information, they can lead to confusion and even viewers to drawing wrong conclusions. (This is also true of graphs that are clear, but less so.) Further, what is lacking in understanding is often overcompensated in conviction. Many misconceptions have been fueled and spread through misleading graphs, or proper graphs accompanied by misleading captions.

Charts
Charts can focus a great deal of attention on a small amount of information or used in a similar way as graphs to show relationships and trends. As with graphs, the choices made in creating the graph is service of the story is vitally important.

(Lulu) Motion Graphics is one to add to taxomony:

Interaction
(Lulu)
Depending on what you want your audience to take away, different types of interaction can be used, as illustrated by these examples:
- Story-telling: http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/07/02/business/economy/20090705-cycles-graphic.html[NYT: Turning a Corner (Economic Cycles)]
- No story, free data exploration by user: http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/HTMLDocs/dvc3/projections.html[ONS: Population Pyramids]
- Learn by having a go: BERG/BBC: http://howbigreally.com/[How big really?]

When you think you're nearly there, try out your visualisation on a handful of other people. Observe them using it, exploring it. It becomes very clear very quickly what users do and don't 'get'. If your users don't realise there's another screen to progress to, all your hard work will have been wasted. Go back and adjust your work to address the obstacles that you saw users encounter.

Examples of good use of visualisations to tell stories

Use language to sound intelligent/ interesting/ like a brilliant writer.	Use language to illuminate meaning in a concise way
Use design language to make things pretty/ interesting/ convince everyone you're a brilliant designer.	Use design language to illuminate meaning in a concise way.




How do you use design language to illuminate meaning in a concise way? (Just ask Tufte!)
Colour: use colour sparingly to highlight information that is more important than others, or show the distinction between two sets of variables. Choose colours that are distinct enough that colourblind individuals are able to read your visualization, and don't use extra colours or patterns unnecessarily.


(Lulu) Colour accessibility tools:
Color Oracle: Shows you in real time what people with common color vision impairments will see http://colororacle.cartography.ch/
snook.ca: Allows you to check colour contrast of a foreground colour against a different background colour: http://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html
Grid lines: grid lines do not add important information to your chart; remove them, and ask yourself if the chart still communicates its message as effectively. If you must use them, make sure they are as visually minimal as possible


(Lulu)
Typography: Complement the story's hierarchy with a visual hierarchy:


- make the title both big and insightful
- label key points directly and bold them up
- hand-hold the user through the structure of the story by distinguishing header text from body text
2D v.s. 3D: Never, ever use 3D graphs. They distract from information and add nothing.


(Lulu)


Layout: Size, position, white space are the variables you have to play with. As a rule of thumb adjust these so the design works for the extreme cases - longest labels, most data, biggest sample, and their smallest counterparts too. Then the rest should all fall into line.
Keys (or legends): Avoid using them whenever possible. It's much more effective to label lines, points, bars directly. If you do have to use a key, put it at the top, in a prominent position.
Platform: Design for the platform that your visualisation is going to live on. If both print and online, re-design it to work on the other one. A print graphic directly uploaded to a website rarely works as well as it could online, and vice versa of course. It's almost always necessary to re-work.
