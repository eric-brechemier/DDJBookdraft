*A new "flavor" of information that reaches a new group of consumers*

[quote, Tom Fries (Bertelsmann Foundation)]
____
In the same way that consumers of the arts might prefer painting to poetry, fashion to film, consumers of information find it easier, or more fun, to consumer information of one type vs. another. A long essay on the Arab Spring reaches a different audience than a 90-second news segment on the same topic. The addition of meaningful and substantial data as a ``format'' for information that could also be delivered in other ways reaches a new segment of information consumers.
____

*As a source of new perspectives*

[quote, Tom Fries (Bertelsmann Foundation)]
____
Good data journalism allows information consumers to see relationships, proportions and other qualities in ways that other formats do not, and different portrayals of information tell different stories, even with the same data.
____

*As a teaching tool for journalists*

[quote, Tom Fries (Bertelsmann Foundation)]
____
In the same way that learning a new language allows a person to begin to make a different set of concepts concrete, learning the skills and tools associated with data journalism improves the thinking of journalists who take the time to do it. The process of adding data journalism to the "toolbox" of the average journalist also forces collaboration with categories of professionals with which journalists are usually not accustomed to working such as developers or designers.
____

*As a forensic tool for readers*

[quote, Tom Fries (Bertelsmann Foundation)]
____
Journalists, and news outlets generally, betray their perspective in the data that they choose to present, and how they choose to present it. A discerning reader can see the output as a "tell" of a journalist's or organization's political or intellectual disposition.
____

*Redressing the balance of power*

[quote, Andrew Mackenzie (Independent Researcher)]
____
"The task of journalism is to hold power to account. The corporate sector and governments have Big Data, and they know more about you than you know about them. Data journalism can help redress the balance of power."

Mapping LA- Los Angeles Times
http://projects.latimes.com/mapping-la/neighborhoods/

What the example is: an interactive map of Los Angeles with:  Crime, Schools, and Demographics data from which a Blog post and social media content is produced as data updates are released. http://projects.latimes.com/mapping-la/neighborhoods/
Why you like it: it´s a different way of telling many many stories, almost without words starting from an interactive map and datasets. For eg. Crime LA: focuses on crime detecting different zones of risk of categorized crimes: http://projects.latimes.com/mapping-la/neighborhoods/neighborhood/hollywood/crime/
Why it is new/interesting/important/distinctive: because it tells so many stories as the data model allows, and automatically generates basic reporting with main rates for calculations on crime or deaths, besides showing census demographics data. The human reporting goes for the main stories, but in one way or the other, everyone is informed.

*Dollars for Doctors*
http://www.propublica.org/series/dollars-for-docs


What the example is: it´s a news application that gathers drug companies data and produces many stories on doctors in the US who receive payments from this companies , to act as speakers, consultants or advisors.
What does it do: besides reporting, it allows people to seach by doctor´s name, by drug company or by state.  The company comparison chart exhibits the level of disclosure of each company http://projects.propublica.org/docdollars/companies


Why you like it: this news application started with 7 and now features 12 drug companies. It shows data in context, it allows people to search and extract reports by companies, doctors or state. The payments per state charts are easy to use and navigate : http://projects.propublica.org/docdollars/states/colorado


Why it is new/interesting/important/distinctive: because it builds and shares data that is unique presented in a friendly way , allowing the audience to ask questions to this datasets and report locally for what is relevant to each one. The open tools (including a widget!) and mindset of Propublica´s team , and the generosity to share their knowledge are part of their success.


MP´s Expenses - The Guardian 
http://mps-expenses.guardian.co.uk/

What the example is: the example consists in a crowdsourcing application developed to make the audience help detect, classify and priorize investigative paths in two different  MPs expenses documentation sets released by Parliament after a long battle of FOI requests by different parties.
What does it do: the application offers users who volunteer a way to help filter PDFs  presented at random and to categorize them topically and classify those who need further investigation.
Why you like it: I like it because it mixes a large unstructured data set with the a large audience, offering to participate to get a structured output, a database.
Why it is new/interesting/important/distinctive:
learning experience: from the first to the second phase, in which the dataset was smaller, they got it fully reviewed.
Impact: the MPs returned up to 500.000 pounds  and now they are more careful about the expenses they register, someone else is watching...

To incorporate into short intro:

A http://datadrivenjournalism.net/news_and_analysis/data_journalism_survey_analysis[survey] on training needs for data journalism circulated by the European Journalism Centre between April and August 2011 showed that 39% of the 234 respondents envisioned their organisation to start engaging in data journalism through engaging a combination of external experts and existing staff. 36% envisioned training existing staff.

In the following chapter journalists involved in data journalism projects explain models for doing data journalism in their newsroom.

In-house expertise
////

////
### Projects realized with external experts

Some datasets or methods require special skills i.e. programming skills to manage the data and visualize it. Don't stop your passion for your idea because of missing these skills in your newsroom. There are a lot of highly motivated developers and designers out there to come into your project.

### Measuring impact ###

Overview: Give overview of the potential of data journalism (e.g. engaging with new audiences, the future of journalism on the web) and how it could be measured.
Authors: Mirko Lorenz (Deutsche Welle), Lorenz Matzat (Open Data City)
Length: 1 page
Editor: Liliana Bounegru

Measuring the success of a data story is in no way different than the generally used indicators: page views, how long people stay on a page, etc.

Data journalists report though that people appear to engage longer with data stories than with other types of posts.

The Texas Tribune databases drive majority of site's traffic, according to a Poynter article.



=== Using Data Journalism to Build Reputation and Trust (Sascha Venohr, Zeit Online) ===

Data journalism projects can bring newsrooms into the exciting position to bring a Wow-Effect to the audience and give a new way of bringing stories and facts on their side. For example, there was a wide coverage about the situation at the nuclear plant in japanese Fukushima after the Tsunami. After radioactive material escaped from the power plant, everyone within 30 kilometres of the plant was evacuated. People could read and see a lot about the evacuations. ZEIT ONLINE found a innovative way to explain it's German audience the impact using data journalism. We asked: How many people live near a nuclear power plant in Germany? How many people lives within a radius of 30 kilometres? A map showes http://opendata.zeit.de/atomreaktoren/#/en/[how many people would have to be evacuated in a similar situation in Germany]. The result: A big traffic success and one of these Wow-Effects waving over the social media sphere. In addition, projects based on structured data can easily adopted to other perspectives and languages. So we did. We transponded the Map to http://opendata.zeit.de/nuclear-reactors-usa/#/en/[nuclear power plants in the US] in an english version. A great traffic-motor again.

Another point is, that news labels want to be respected as a trusted source. Using data journalism projects combined with enabling the readers to look and reuse the raw data brings a high value of credibility to these newsrooms. As the Guardian says: facts are sacred.

Introduction

by Lucy Chambers
In this chapter, we aim to show you how to get your hands on the best data available to further your investigation. Sometimes you don't have to look far, the data may already be out there: it is a matter of knowing where to look. Other times, you may need to find the right people to ask. In particular, this chapter deals with:
  *  	Tips and tricks for where to look for data: before launching into FOI requests or embarking down a technical route such as scraping.
  *  	Search tips: How to make Google give you want you want, in the format you want it.
  *    Communities for data: useful forums and mailing lists to ask experts directly
  *  	Data houses: data catalogues, government portals, accessing research data and social data sites
Finally, we'll have a quick look at the legal implications of re-using data from web databases - while you may decide to break copyright to get your story out, it is still useful to know the boundaries in current law.

### Reference data ###

by Friedrich Lindenberg

It's often helpful to pull in data from code sheets, such as lists of countries, states, organizations etc. This kind of data - which is used to augment another collection - is called reference data. Other examples of reference data include code sheets to decipher classifications and taxonomies, such as the EU's procurement vocabulary: on most portals, only short identifiers are provided, while the actual term descriptions are quite helpful.

Some sources for reference data include:
  *    http://www.geonames.org/[GeoNames] and http://open.mapquestapi.com/nominatim/[Nominatim] for geographic names and coordinates.
  *    National statistics agencies
  *    Web sites of standards bodies, such as the ISO (e.g. country codes) or the http://iatistandard.org/[IATI Standard] site.
  *    International organisations such as the United Nations (e.g. classification of functions of government).



-------

Information held by public bodies is one of the principle sources of data for the work of any journalist. The right of access to information (aka "freedom of information") is the right of anyone to access information held by public authorities. Many countries now have freedom of information laws to make this information available to the public. This chapter deals with:
FOIA for data - what to ask for, what format to request it in and how to ask for it
Case studies about stories based on successful data FOI requests.



For more detailed information on the process of submitting an FOI request, the difference in FOI legislation in different countries and appeal procedures see the FOI tipsheet.


-------

Privacy Concerns and FOI for databases


Privacy concerns: For data journalists trying to get access to a full data set, issue might come up because some of the information in the data set is confidential and the public authority uses this as a reason for not providing the entire database. This is not acceptable under the right of access to information: public bodies have to provide at least partial access.

For example, by removing personal data fields from the database so that the data journalist can see all the statistical and factual data the public authority would not be violating confidentiality. All exceptions must be justified by the public body and you have a right to appeal.
TIP: "Look at the 'disclosure logs' that some public authorities have on their websites, which list some or all of their responses to previous FOI requests. They are a good source of ideas about what kind of information you are actually likely to obtain." (Martin Rosenbaum - BBC)

Crowdsourcing can be helpful both for collecting data - e.g. using forms, polls, social media, or dedicated apps - and cleaning up, exploring or making sense of big datasets you already have but that are too big for you to look through by yourself. It can also be a good way to get different perspectives on a subject as readers can point out details that you might not have noticed.


------


How to collect data from content already published in social media 

using Twitter hashtags (examples: emergency hashtags used in the event of an earthquake or huricane in the US)
using Tools such as:

People Browser
Social mention (media monitoring tools)
Disqus

Keyword search, what is discussed about specific topics on the web? 
Look for the right keywords. Certain topics have different words in different countries (football, soccer, etc.). 
Make your search as specified or as wide as possible, as adapted as possible to your search. 
consider language, country, target groups 
gather information from different platforms to get a common opinion
cross check to make sure the information is reliable and consistent

Other ideas for this section:

  * Preparing Data
  * Reconciliation
  * Combining Datasets (cf: http://www.opendatacookbook.net/wiki/recipe/a_dataset_mixture_with_yahoo_pipes)
  * Text Mining

Working with data implies identifying, collecting, cleaning, analyzing, using and sharing the data you are using for your story. When working with data, you will find this iterative and potentially messy. Sometimes you will know exactly what you are looking for, and sometimes you will go fishing. Occasionally a story will emerge from the data. Often, you will be able to complement a story with more hard evidence or helpful information so readers can understand better.

* Be aware of the provenance and terms of use of your data
* Understand the limitations of your data (Is it reliable? Is it accurate?)
* Be transparent about how you used the data so others can use it.

**5. Analyzing your data**

After collecting data (Chapter 2) it is important to understand your dataset.
What type of analysis do you need to do? What are you comparing?
Time-based
Geographic regions
Cross-sectional: what are the portions of the whole (e.g., by race for census data)

Depending on what kind of data analysis you are doing, there are a range of different types of tools you can use. For this see chapter 3.3 Tools for Analysing data.	

Detecting dodgy data

Not all data comes from measurement of real-life numbers. From individuals to organisations, the pressure to support an argument with stats can unfortunately lead people to fabricate, falsify and omit data.

Even those who understand the importance of good data aren't beyond reproach: for example, http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005738[2% of scientists have admitted to tampering with data]. This is a conservative estimate based on surveys, so the true number of researchers who have committed fraud through data manipulation may be much higher.

So how do you identify dodgy data? Although it's impossible to spot fraud simply by looking at numbers directly, luckily there are a few statistical tests that can help you detect anomalies. One of the most practical is a strange statistical phenomenon known as Benford's law, or the leading-digit law.

According to Benford's law, in a list of numbers from natural sources of data, the leading digit (e.g. the 1 in 10) is not distributed randomly. While you might expect the digits 0 to 9 to each be found in 11 per cent of cases, the digit 1 actually appears about 30% of the time. The other digits appear in lower and lower frequencies, following an exponential decline, ending with numbers that have a leading 9 only occurring in under 5% of numbers from the list.

This phenomenon appears in many lists of data from natural sources, which means that deviations from Benford's law may indicate false data. If you plot each leading digit in a data set against the frequency with which they appear, you should get a graph showing an exponential decline, which is what you would expect from Benford's law.

To test whether your data is dodgy, all you have to do it take the leading digit from a list of numbers in your data, tally the number of times each digit appears, and then superimpose this over a Benford curve. If your data matches the expected curve, then your data is probably free of fabrication.

Roles of visualisation in journalism by Lulu Pinney

The function of data visualisations in reportage is twofold. Firstly they are a tool for exploring the data to find where any stories are. Their second use is for telling a story. And it is worth noting that - for the same set of data - it is more than likely that the visuals best suited to finding a story will not be best suited to the telling of it.

Using visualisations to explore data is a more objective exercise, and sometimes it is appropriate to create an interface so your audience can have a go themselves. Alternatively having explored and interpreted the data yourself, you can choose just to present the stories you have found in a more subjective - or editorial - manner to your audience, with or without supporting visualisations.

more on this from Sarah Cohen at the end of Feb.; more specifically Mainly on the use of it inside the newsroom to hone the story -- expanding on that handout you found. The real weakness there is that there are not good, free tools to use when you're not willing to make your data public.

=== Citizen Engagement with Data Journalism (César Viana, Estacio de Sa University) ===

////

Insert: picture from projects

////

Journalism demands engagement with the public. This is a feature since the first newspapers that also influenced the creation of nation-states in the 17th century. At that time readers identified themselves with each other because at least they shared similar culture, imaginary, language and community interests. Whether this interaction is now through text, audio, audiovisual, animation or any other new visualization processes, trust and transparency are still crucial among journalists and citizen stakeholders.
Much before having any kind of communication technology our civilization were founded on storytelling and connection among people. A story is relevant as far as the audiences feel represented on it. But it took us centuries to improve the ways to bring people, and nations, closer to each other in a global - and almost apt to be scrutinized - scene. But the challenge still resides on experimenting emerging principles and practice of citizen engagement on inclusive journalistic perspectives to foster information access and popular participation.
Preparing and implementing editorial products based on datasets include as well participating on social conversations and considering user-centred design of information to better achieve citizen involvement. There are innovative ways to monitor feedbacks and civic participation on the social web and to encourage the creation of environments for dialog and social innovation.
A news professional might be prepared to attend the demands of the public and influence their capacity to act alongside their peers. The more people take ownership of these communication resources; greater are the reflections of the journalistic efforts in the everyday of society and vice versa.
Despite of being able to create data-driven journalism applications and services that are representative and able for accomplishing social improvements, the role of journalists is also enhance the social inclusion and education. A decisive way to do this is collaborate with the approach between the civic society stakeholders and the practitioners or researchers of ICT's into human-centred outlooks.
The multidisciplinarity common to the variety of editorial sections of journalism has always collaborated with the interrelationship among different domains. When drawing or implementing strategies and plans consider leveraging opportunities and providing the knowledge and the skills to warrant inclusiveness, diversity and innovation in our societies. Make sure your project contributes to empower people through technology and/or media literacy.
If only by consuming or sharing news, the public is involved in modeling of information systems. Therefore, it is necessary to provide the best resources for collaboration and joint construction of stories. There is a growing emergence of examples that stand out in this foray:

http://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/introducing-docdiver[DocDiver] is an application to stimulate readers on working beside ProPublica investigative reporters' team to identify and share key bits of information in documents.

http://www.documentcloud.org/home[DocumentCloud] is preparing a new feature to engage readers in discussing and crowdsourcing news by allowing them to add their own notes and comments to material collected and displayed.

http://www.ft.com/intl/eu-funds[EUfunds] is collaboration between the Financial Times and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism to help readers on tracking European Union structural funds.

https://www.drumbeat.org/en-US/journalism/about/[MoJo] is the Knight-Mozilla partnership to bring together technologists and journalists in developing innovative solutions.

http://www.a24media.com/whatsyourstory/[Africa: What's Your Story] is a collaborative platform of the citizen news agency A24Media to implicate people from across the continent on sharing information about media freedom, corruption, health, education and other issues in video, text and audio.

The collaborative ways of treating or recirculating information and the bias for popular mobilizations are already means for important changes in this recent world of new media, big data sources and participatory culture. Even if only around 30 percent of the world population was online by the end 2010 (source: http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/publications/idi/2011/index.html[2011 ITU report]), there are space for commitment to spread the principles of freedom and to share experiences, best practice and opportunities to improve the capability of citizens and other stakeholders to write/interact/play/sense the next chapters of the history of press.

There are many tools that simplify the creation of maps from digital data. 
http://code.google.com/apis/maps/index.html

This classic map shows the advance and retreat of Napolean's army in Russia using width to indicate army size, color to represent direction and a sharp aesthetic to show the severity of the event. http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/posters



Graphs
There are many ways to use graphs to visualize data. Data sets that focus on pairs of information such as quantity x over time or age over height are often prime. A third piece of data can usually be shown through size or color of data points. For trending information and regular distributions, such as population over time lines can connect points. Multiple sets of relevant information can also be plotted so long as they are distinguished. This can be helpful in showing upper and lower bounds or the way in which two related quantities move together over time.

It is important to keep your target audience in mind when using graphs, more so even than most other forms of visualization. Graphs are technical things. If they aren't clear or contain extraneous information, they can lead to confusion and even viewers to drawing wrong conclusions. (This is also true of graphs that are clear, but less so.) Further, what is lacking in understanding is often overcompensated in conviction. Many misconceptions have been fueled and spread through misleading graphs, or proper graphs accompanied by misleading captions.

Charts
Charts can focus a great deal of attention on a small amount of information or used in a similar way as graphs to show relationships and trends. As with graphs, the choices made in creating the graph is service of the story is vitally important.

(Lulu) Motion Graphics is one to add to taxomony:

Interaction
(Lulu)
Depending on what you want your audience to take away, different types of interaction can be used, as illustrated by these examples:
- Story-telling: http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/07/02/business/economy/20090705-cycles-graphic.html[NYT: Turning a Corner (Economic Cycles)]
- No story, free data exploration by user: http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/HTMLDocs/dvc3/projections.html[ONS: Population Pyramids]
- Learn by having a go: BERG/BBC: http://howbigreally.com/[How big really?]

When you think you're nearly there, try out your visualisation on a handful of other people. Observe them using it, exploring it. It becomes very clear very quickly what users do and don't 'get'. If your users don't realise there's another screen to progress to, all your hard work will have been wasted. Go back and adjust your work to address the obstacles that you saw users encounter.

Use design language to make things pretty/ interesting/ convince everyone you're a brilliant designer.	Use design language to illuminate meaning in a concise way.




How do you use design language to illuminate meaning in a concise way? (Just ask Tufte!)
Colour: use colour sparingly to highlight information that is more important than others, or show the distinction between two sets of variables. Choose colours that are distinct enough that colourblind individuals are able to read your visualization, and don't use extra colours or patterns unnecessarily.


(Lulu) Colour accessibility tools:
Color Oracle: Shows you in real time what people with common color vision impairments will see http://colororacle.cartography.ch/
snook.ca: Allows you to check colour contrast of a foreground colour against a different background colour: http://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html
Grid lines: grid lines do not add important information to your chart; remove them, and ask yourself if the chart still communicates its message as effectively. If you must use them, make sure they are as visually minimal as possible


(Lulu)
Typography: Complement the story's hierarchy with a visual hierarchy:


- make the title both big and insightful
- label key points directly and bold them up
- hand-hold the user through the structure of the story by distinguishing header text from body text
2D v.s. 3D: Never, ever use 3D graphs. They distract from information and add nothing.


(Lulu)


Layout: Size, position, white space are the variables you have to play with. As a rule of thumb adjust these so the design works for the extreme cases - longest labels, most data, biggest sample, and their smallest counterparts too. Then the rest should all fall into line.
Keys (or legends): Avoid using them whenever possible. It's much more effective to label lines, points, bars directly. If you do have to use a key, put it at the top, in a prominent position.
Platform: Design for the platform that your visualisation is going to live on. If both print and online, re-design it to work on the other one. A print graphic directly uploaded to a website rarely works as well as it could online, and vice versa of course. It's almost always necessary to re-work.

=== Data Driven Apps at Internews in Kenya (Mark Irungu, Internews Network) ===

On the 6th of July 2011, the Kenyan government became the first in Africa to have a national open data portal. Making government data open is not a very popular idea that regimes would readily embrace in Africa, not with the rampant corruption and mismanagement of public funds. Understandably, the Kenyan Government has received a lot of accolades for that.

While this World Bank supported initiative received a lot of praise globally (from the New York Times to government heads in the developed world) the scenario was different locally. It was great news in the techie world but just another tiny story in the world of journalism. The story was not covered beyond the day of the launch. Few journalists visited portal after the launch. The data is accessible online and just like all data sets; it is not in the smallest way friendly to the eye, at least not a journalist's eye.

*The GAP*

The techies have taken the idea and run with it, trying to think of applications that could be developed to mine the data, clean the data and visualise it making it more accessible to people beyond the developer community.

A new digital divide exists, not just in Kenya, between journalists and developers in working with data. Journalists need to learn more about the mechanics of using data. Developers, also called techies, also have a lot to learn. Developers may be brilliant with code, but have a lot to learn with regard to content, the opposite is true for journalists. Why not leverage these strengths to form a `tag team'? They do not necessarily have to be at the same place at the same time, all we need is an interface co connect them. What the data world needs is a good app that can serve these groups.

*The APP*

The power of data cannot be under estimated. It is time that newsrooms and journalists moved away from the ``he said, she said'' reporting. Numbers can help journalists produce in-depth features, and explore untold stories and trends that are not immediately known or visible to the general public. Unfortunately, journalists in Kenya have not made good use of the opened data. I work at Internews in Kenya - a media development organisation that trains and supports journalists to be better storytellers. In our journalism workshops we have designed a number of courses to help journalists use numbers and data better for their storytelling. This is important as it helps journalists to enrich their enquiry and stories.

It is with this realisation that the idea of developing an app to query KODI was born. There is need for a a solution that would help journalists clean up raw data in the back end and help journalist to identify emerging stories and trends.That app should also help in presenting the content in visually appealing ways. 

The app should:

1. Query the entire Kenya open data portal.
2. Clean the data / provide a friendly interface for cleaning the data.
3. Visualise the data.
4. Generate reports that can be used as is.

*The Target*

We are facing a unique scenario. Who were we targeting? We have had to determine whether this is going to be a case of old hands, new tricks or new hands, new tricks. Traditional journalism has undergone a radical evolution process with the development of the web. Maybe that was enough. Yes there is a significant gap between journalists and techies, but we have also established that the desire to among journalists to learn and possibly close this gap is very strong . The `evolved' traditional journalist has been showing willingness to undergo a second metamorphosis and the upcoming journalist doesn't mind this baptism of fire. The app we are working will serve journalists at all levels.

*The Team and the Technology*

Over the past 8 years, Internews has worked in Kenya with journalists to build capacity in health and conflict sensitive reporting through training, mentoring, travel grants and availing resources for journalists at the Nairobi and Eldoret offices. The idea of developing an app has come hand in hand with the idea of setting up a Center for Digital journalism at the Kenya office. This centre does more or less what Internews has been doing but at a digital scale. The centre also `incubates' upcoming and evolving data/digital journalists and has facilities that aid such journalists in production of complex and compelling stories.

To develop this app, we have had to face the fact that we do not know everything and we needed to talk to those who may have taken our path before leveraging on our relationship with various developer communities in Nairobi to form a team that would work towards our end product. Our first choice approach was the use of PHP ZEND framework and ADOBE flex and flash builder 4.5 for php. We initially felt these platforms would be sufficient to start us off. However, along the way we have picked up on other technologies that we believe will spice up the end result e.g. the Data Journalism Developer Studio running on open Linux. The tool will run across all platforms; web, desktop, mobile. With the high uptake and use of mobile phones in Kenya, it is Important that all Open data tools should be able to run on mobile platforms (J2ME, Android).

Developers vary in coding strengths and language preferences. After determining which languages our platform would run on, we have had to identify strong team members that would deliver the quality of code that would make this world-class product. We have also distinguished those working on the front end (user experience) and those working on the back end (dirty work). The two teams have to sync at the application level and there is need for a strong working relationship.

Kenya has clearly made some bold steps but there is still a lot of ground to cover. The biggest challenge is not coming up with the idea but in having a worthy team. An outcome based approach team that endears its energies to the overall objective makes product successful. If used well, data can be life changing. Electoral dynamics especially in voting patterns in Kenya have been devoid of content and objectivity. With available data, this and many other systems in Kenya can change for the better. 

**2. How to build a news app**

A news app is a software (web, desktop, mobile, USSD) that acts as an interface between the database layer of the information architecture and the client side. News apps make data friendlier to the client as compared to the format and layout at the storage engine. 

News Apps vary in type:

1. Curation- This is an app that gathers already existing information and brings it to one platform based on a particular keyword(s). This kind of app may not necessarily have its own storage engine, some depend on a 'Google type' indexing mechanism that crawls the net and indexes searchable information. Examples of Curation APPS; Storify, Storyful.

2. News Portals- these are online news portals that deliver news in real time. News websites, news applications running on mobile platforms, aggregated feed readers fall in this category.

3. Citizen reporting- these are apps whose main source of data is the citizen. These apps provide an interface for citizen-journalism and then visualise the data graphically or on a map. E.g.: Ushahidi, crowdmap, swiftriver.

4. Data apps - These are apps that query DATA sets from governments, organisations, civil society etc. These Apps may have their own storage engine that is updated regularly from the main data source e.g. World Bank finances, Kenya open data. Examples of such applications: CDF monitor (Kenya) Internews Open DATA app (Kenya).

*Why and for who?*

News Apps are not for journalists only. Most news apps are coded to produce interactive and friendly reports that can be used by any news savvy person. The act of interacting with a news app looking for news is in itself journalism. Newsrooms, News organisations, governments, and civil society should commission development of news apps based on need.

In the age of open source tools, re-inventing the wheel is not necessary. When making the decision to develop a news app, it is imperative to survey the current news landscape and identify tools that do at least half of what you'd like to see. Chances are that in most instances you may just combine two different tools with great precision. For example, when working on large data sets you may be looking for a tool that will clean the data and also visualise it in clean interactive graphs, charts, bubbles and possibly maps. You may want, in this instance, to clean the data on Google Refine, and then export the data to Tile Mill to visualise it on a map and to infogr.am to plot it on a matrix! 

However, there are rare scenarios like that of Kenya where relationships between datasets need to be established on the fly in order to generate some visualisations that may require you to develop an app altogether. This saves the non-techie journalist the hassle, for example, of trying to join a table with all constituencies in Kenya with another with their latitude and longitude co-ordinates in order to plot the info on a map.

The main idea of developing a news app should be motivated by the need to make data friendlier. If your news app does not make your numbers easier to understand then it is not worth the time and money.

A good news app should:

1. Mine the data- extracting data sets from the source.
2. Clean the data- pick out anomalies in the data and highlight them to the user. The user then corrects the anomalies.
3. Export data- have export data functionality.
4. Visualise the data

Open source apps have indeed made things easier for all of us; the ability to even alter the source code of a free product release under the GPL license is particularly enticing. It is however important to apply news apps to the context for which they were developed and not to the context that cuts costs for you as a news organisation. 

A classical example is the Ushahidi platform; Ushahidi was built mainly for crisis citizen reporting. It worked perfect during the post election violence in Kenya and mapping of hotspots, and even better during the Haiti earthquake and the BP oil spill. But it stops working when used for activities that do not engage citizens to report e.g. mapping out country offices of an organisation. 

*Packaging*
 
The success or failure of an app is strongly dependent on how it is packaged. Packaging in this case refers mainly to the platforms for which it is built. Developers should aim at presenting very flexible and useable apps. Limiting an app to one operating system e.g. Windows is a big setback and significantly contributes to the failure of the app.

To counter such issues, developers are encouraged to come up with fully functional online versions of applications before thinking of the desktop app. An online app only locks out someone without a browser! Desktop versions and mobile versions should be added features and not the other way round.

*Resources*

Having powerful computers, big screens, servers and test platforms is a good thing when developing a news app, having good human resources is even better. The skill set required in this case is unique: a combination of UX, backend and security is required. Developers should take advantage and participate in online communities, developer meet ups, hackathons, workshops and boot camps to sharpen their skills. Technology, just like traditional journalism, is constantly evolving and every developer should work with this realisation. Laxity is not an option.

What about rights clearance? While you should always clear all of this with your legal team, as a rule of thumb: if it is published by government you should be able to ask forgiveness not permission; if it is published by an organisation that doesn't make money selling data you shouldn't have to worry too much; if it is published by a organisation that does make money from selling data, then you should definitely ask permission.

How do you choose what stories to focus on? 

Idea for story
Or something someone is obsessed about
How do you choose?
You have to pick stuff that is interesting to you
If its interesting to me then at least one person is going to read it ;-)
80% of time faffing about with data - gov data often needs cleaning up
Tons of stuff in PDF
Spending data - lots of stuff is incorrect

Excel more than anything else
Google Refine
One example of really unstructured data was riots. Court reports including on riot offences
Quicker to pay 7 people for a week than to scrape it
Painful
Had to pick out cases manually
Ended up typing it in

Once you have the data

Don't have a lot of time

Often you want to have lots of time, things on boil for months

Rarely have time

Fusion tables is easiest mapping tool - easiest tool to map data quickly
E.g. Wikileaks - throw data in and make a map in half an hour

Design house for visualisation

Tableux - but not available for Macs

Still use Many Eyes, but still a bit passe

Tree map for text - neat visual trick

In house tools - e.g. sortable tables on a page very quickly

Reorder table to see order

Amount of time spent on an article is 6 minutes - compared to average of 1 minutes

Map of where verified instances were happening

Mapping addresses of people involved in riots with poverty indicators. Took a couple of days. Had 1000 cases. Made it onto front page of paper.

Working on project on riots with Rowntree Foundation.

Something started with Itoworld

3-4 major crowdsourcing exercise

Simon Willison

450,000 documents

Much easier to navigate MP expenses

Enter data - capturing structured data on expenses

Tip off tool

50% done

Make it a game - gave people tasks

Look at Cabinet, etc.

Learnt a lot from doing it once.

Maritime museum are crowdsourcing records - 10 people for each one and cross checking.

James Ball did

Best crowdsourcing thing we ever did was with Olympic ticketing system.

If you can pledge money you get tickets, lots of people didn't get tickets.

How many people applied for tickets and how many they got.

Google Form - makes a spreadsheet.

Sarah Palin emails. Lots of PDFs. 1000s of emails.

List all of #occupy protests that are happening. Verified by people other than people occupying. Google Form on report. This is our list are there any we've missed. Had 1500-2000 responses. 500 duplicates. Putting them on Google Fusion tables.

1st year: Simon - with access to people in the Guardian
Two researchers: Lisa + Amy
Three: James Ball - does more longer term stuff
Simon does quicker stuff

Some access to developers, but mainly try and do stuff that anyone can replicate. Try to do things which other people can replicate and provide input and feedback etc.

Wary of doing anything too complicated. Or doing analysis that is done by experts.

Forced by necessity to do things that anyone can do.

Swamps of stuff - "what can you do with this data" - Flickr group. Good people post stuff. 1400 active members.

Off the shelf Web 2.0.

There are going to be people who can do better stuff than us. We focus on getting good reportage, and focusing on what we do best.

Publish everything using Google Spreadsheets.

Wanted to have proper database, but couldn't get any dev time.

Tony Hirst has done amazing things.

So much stuff you can build off Google Spreadsheets.

Whole Guardian site is open source - CMS.

Datablog has highlighted tools that are part of CMS but no-one else really used.

NYT does get work embedding short video clips in stories.

North and South of Italy with GDP.

Really lucky: sit right next to main news at Guardian. Find stories from data and talk to news editor.

Workflow starts in Excel. Such an easy way to quickly work out if there's something the data. Then if you have a sense that there is something in it then go to news desk. Then look at how we should visualise it or show it on the page. Then write the post that goes with it. Cut down version of spreadsheet next to the text editor. Often doing analysis while writing to pick out interesting things. Then publish post. Spend time Tweeting, writing to different people and making sure that it is linked to from all the right places.

Half traffic from some posts will come from Twitter/FB.



Arguments to convince colleagues. Comes from stories: COINS, Wikileaks + riots. Newspapers are driven by the stories and traffic.

COINS: 5-6 specialists reporters from the Guardian working on it.
Wikileaks: big. Iraq and Afghanistan.
Spending over 25k: government gave data in advance. Team working on it. Team of 5-6 specialists. Including people like Polly Curtis.
Riots: another big one. 550k in two days.

Twitter: #uksnow tweeted postcode + how deep snow was. Looking at hashtags.

6 minutes is a good number. Key metrics is time on the page.

Data blog got 2.5 million unique hits. Guardian gets 52 million as a whole.

Hashtags: people doing work with sentiment analysis. Lots of interesting stuff you can do with hashtags. Riots data. Fantastic set of data. #Riotcleanup was biggest tag.
